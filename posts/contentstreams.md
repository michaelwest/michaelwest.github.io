# Twitter and Reddit content streams

- reddit best of subreddit
- twitter user centric vs reddit topic centric
-- twitter attempts at topics aren't great
-- can twitter do better at finding you interesting users, eg which conservatives are often followed by progressives
-- is each person "containing multitudes" a helpful or unhelpful thing?

- for both, content frequency -- usually it's a binary subscription
-- Facebook "see less" is a good idea

- new account experience, how can you set people up for success
- how can you let people tune their experience?
-- transparency about why you're seeing something
