# Simple D&D
_ A ruleset for developing D&D narrative episodes, and letting more people be DMs _

## Motivation
D&D provides a great framework for imaginative thinking. But its complex rules of D&D are intimidating for prospective players and even more so for prospective DMs. Even the [Basic Rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules) have fifteen chapters and four appendices. This is a barrier for people with interesting narrative ideas from expressing those in a game. They can also dramatically slow the pace of gameplay for inexperienced players, implying a greater time commitment. The goal here is to produce something at the complexity level of a moderate board game. It is focused on one-shot adventures rather than levelling up over time. There is an emphasis on discretion rather than strict enumeration.

## Player Characters
### Abilities
- Characters have five abilities: STR, INT, DEX, CON, CHA.
- These are expressed purely as a modifier, rather than an underlying value which maps to a modifier. So STR 1 means +1 to all strength checks.
- When creating a character, players start with all abilities at 0. They can then modify scores by distributing 6 free points plus any further points they sacrifice off another ability. So a fighter might have STR 4, CON 2, DEX 0, INT 0, CHA 0 -- or STR 4, CON 3, DEX 1, INT -1, CHA -1.
- The max/min ranges for ability are at the discretion of the DM, but maybe +4/-4 is reasonable.

### Races
- Race adds +1 to one score and +1 to skills in a certain area. 
- Races are: 
  - Human: +1 STR, +1 on conversation-related skills
  - Dwarf: +1 CON, +1 on resilience-related skills
  - Elf: +1 INT, +1 on perception-related skills
  - Halfling: +1 DEX, +1 on stealth-related skills

### Classes
- Class adds +1 to one score and affects hit dice. 
- Use of class features (magic, feats of strength, etc) is inherent in ability scores: a fighter can try using magic but given likely low INT, will probably fail.
- Classes are:
  - Fighter: +1 STR, d10
  - Wizard: +1 INT, d6
  - Rogue: +1 DEX, d8
  - Adventurer: +1 to any one score, d8 -- open class for any other character that a player wants to use, e.g. Bard with +1 CHA
- Variant classes are just absorbed into the main classes and role-played differently:
  - Fighter: Paladin, Barbarian, etc
  - Wizard: Cleric, Monk, etc
  - Rogue: Ranger, etc

### Skills & Checks
- There are no skills to be selected. Skill bonuses are inherent in the choice of ability scores. If you want to be good at stealth, get more DEX.
- Skill checks are taken with a d20 + relevant ability against DC chosen by DM (10 = Easy, 20 = Hard, 30 = Almost impossible)
- The "relevant ability" can be chosen by the DM but guidelines are:
  - STR: Lifting, carrying, pushing, breaking, jumping, climbing
  - DEX: Balancing, sneaking, hiding (character or object), stealing, lockpicking/trap disabling
  - INT: Recognising, perceiving
  - CHA: Interacting, deceiving, performing, persuading
