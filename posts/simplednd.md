# Simple D&D
A simplified ruleset to help making D&D narratives more accessible

## Motivation
D&D provides a great framework for imaginative thinking. But its complex rules of D&D are intimidating for prospective players and even more so for prospective DMs. Even the [Basic Rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules) have fifteen chapters and four appendices. This is a barrier for people with interesting narrative ideas from expressing those in a game. They can also dramatically slow the pace of gameplay for inexperienced players, implying a greater time commitment. The goal here is to produce something at the complexity level of a moderate board game. It is focused on one-shot adventures rather than levelling up over time; it is also mainly focused on early characters, but could be extended for higher-level characters. There is an emphasis on DM discretion rather than strict enumeration.

## Player Characters
### Abilities
- Characters have five abilities: **STR, INT, DEX, CON, CHA**.
- These are expressed purely as a modifier, rather than an underlying value which maps to a modifier. So STR 1 means +1 to all strength checks.
- When creating a character, players start with all abilities at 0. They can then modify scores by distributing 6 free points plus any further points they sacrifice off another ability. So a fighter might have STR 4, CON 2, DEX 0, INT 0, CHA 0 -- or STR 4, CON 3, DEX 1, INT -1, CHA -1.
- The max/min ranges for ability are at the discretion of the DM, but maybe +4/-4 is reasonable.

### Races
- Race adds +1 to one score and +1 to skills in a certain area. 
- Races are: 
  - **Human**: +1 STR, +1 on conversation-related skill checks
  - **Dwarf**: +1 CON, +1 on resilience-related skill checks
  - **Elf**: +1 INT, +1 on perception-related skill checks
  - **Halfling**: +1 DEX, +1 on stealth-related skill checks

### Classes
- Class adds +1 to one score. Class also provides a dice that is used for hit dice and for weapon damage (see below on equipment).
- Use of class features (magic, feats of strength, etc) is inherent in ability scores: a fighter can try using magic but given likely low INT, will probably fail.
- Classes are:
  - **Fighter**: +1 STR, d10
  - **Wizard**: +1 INT, d6
  - **Rogue**: +1 DEX, d8; may use DEX for melee attacks
  - Adventurer: +1 to any one score, d8 -- open class for any other character that a player wants to use, e.g. Bard with +1 CHA
- Variant classes are just absorbed into the main classes and role-played differently:
  - Fighter: Paladin, Barbarian, etc
  - Wizard: Cleric, Monk, etc
  - Rogue: Ranger, etc

### Equipment
- Complexity of equipment is significantly de-emphasised so that users can focus on role-playing / what's cool to them.
- **Weapons**: Players can have arbitrary weapon/s as appropriate. See attacks below.
- **Armour**: There are three choices with associated Armour Class (AC):
  - Light: AC = 11 + DEX.
  - Medium: AC = 14 + DEX (max +2 from DEX) 
  - Heavy: AC = 17, must have STR 2 to wear, -2 to DEX checks
- **Equipment**: Players can have arbitrary other equipment that seems appropriate - including default gear like torches, rope, and flasks, and anything class- or race-specific they think to add, like lock picks or a musical instrument.

## Mechanics
### Skills & Checks
- There are no skills to be selected. Skill bonuses are inherent in the choice of ability scores. If you want to be good at stealth, get more DEX.
- Skill checks are taken with a d20 + relevant ability against DC chosen by DM (10 = Easy, 20 = Hard, 30 = Almost impossible)
- The "relevant ability" can be chosen by the DM but guidelines are:
  - STR: Lifting, carrying, pushing, breaking, jumping, climbing, wrestling
  - DEX: Balancing, sneaking, hiding (character or object), stealing, lockpicking/trap disabling
  - INT: Recognising, perceiving, finding, healing
  - CHA: Interacting, deceiving, performing, persuading
- Passive checks (e.g. does the party notice something) can be taken by the DM, with 10 + relevant ability against the DC.

### Combat
- Roll for **initiative** using d20 + DEX ability; take turns in initiative order.
  - If surprise is achieved (e.g. character's stealth check beats enemy's perception check), that character gets a free turn before anything else.
- On each turn, move and take one action. Everyone has the same speed - decide for each battle what is appropriate based on the terrain.
- **Actions**:
  - Melee attack: attack adjacent square, use STR (Rogue may use DEX)
  - Ranged attack: attack non-adjacent square, use DEX
  - Cast a spell (see spells)
  - Movement-related: sprint (double movement)
  - Perform any normal check action e.g. hide, climb, wrestle, heal
- **Attacks**:
  - Attack rolls are d20 + ability modifier + any magical weapon modifier; and must be greater than target Armour to hit.
  - On a successful hit, they do the amount of damage for their class dice. For example, a fighter might be using a sensible longsword or maniacally waving two morningstars, but either way it's a d10 for damage. Magic weapons may add additional damage at DM's discretion.
  - An unmodified roll of 20 always hits regardless of AC, and is a critical hit - roll two dice instead of one.
- Damage types - can be introduced only when needed at the DM's discretion:
  - An enemy may be resistant, immune or highly susceptible to certain types of damage. Adjust however seems appropriate.
  - Weapons or spells may put a character or enemy into a state (e.g. on fire, poisoned) that does a bit more damage in subsequent turns.
- **Cover**: Partial cover behind an obstacle gives +2 AC, full cover prevents attack.
- **Dying**: The nature of these rules is that stakes should generally be lower than real D&D, and the risk of true character death minimised. At 0 HP, a character falls unconscious. Each turn, they lose 2 HP unless healed or stabilised. The DM may choose to set a threshold where the character actually dies.
