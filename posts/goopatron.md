# Goop-a-tron

"The meaning of life is to find a life worth living and to have that life, in your heart. That is what makes the art of hell so profound."

Inspired by "Bloosh", _Parks & Recreation_'s parody of Gwyneth Paltrow's controversial lifestyle site "Goop", I wanted to see if an AI could generate similar wellness babble. I scraped about 100 articles from Goop and used [Max Woolf's Colab notebook](https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/) to use those articles to briefly train the [OpenAI GPT-2 language model](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/). The trained model then generated all the text below. I've picked the best bits and in some cases lightly edited for punctuation; text in italics was part of a prompt given to the system.

Because I scraped articles from the wellness section, the text is biased towards discussions of health, diet, and inner peace, as opposed to say, the right kind of biodynamic cashmere to wear at St Tropez. Interestingly, the food text seemed to reveal a hidden yearning for junk food beneath all the kale smoothie discussion - see 'Cheat Meals' below - and some pretty intense drugs crop up among the 'Wellness Products'.


## Experiences
> Standing in line at the petrol station Aksarash Green, I asked, “Who made the Himalayas?”

> But there is more to life than just the road. There are moments of transcendence and beauty that go beyond your typical just-completed trip to the spa.

> _The best way to spend a holiday_ is with someone you care about, like your grandkids or grandkids or the nieces and nephews. And to do that, you have to be willing to put your own life at risk.

> When someone at the Buddhist Ministry of India suggested that we stop by their office in Goa to meet with them, we got straight to the point. Why not google them? We did it by asking our favorite Bollywoods, listening to their favorite podcasts, and browsing through their Flickr photobooks.

> After spending my break at the beach with a hot dog and a salad, I headed to the sand dunes to look for my lost clients. There, I met with the monks to discuss my dilemma and resolve to move forward as a person of kindness and compassion. As I opened my mind to who I was and what I was doing, I also opened my mind to what I would do if confronted with a choice. What do I eat for protection from the elements? What habit do I keep? When will the hard work come first? Acknowledge your surroundings and listen to the wind.

> There is no way to know for sure why the child did this or that thing, but a team of scientists has concocted a theory: The most efficient way to arouse conscience is to watch children struggle to a point where they are no more than obstacles to further growth and to higher achievement. "The most courageous child is the one who most needs spiritual growth." —Dana Childs

## Gwyneth

> _Gwyneth was trying to feel better about life._ But in the end, it wasn’t about healing—it was about destroying it.

> _Gwyneth always says_ to be extra careful when you’re with us—because we’re looking for your sparkly change of heart. And when she does, we’re sure to find something so spectacular—its day will be terrifying.

> _Gwyneth always says_ she needs to infiltrate the subconscious mind of a few thousand people a day. So she has a few tools in her arsenal:
> 1 -  A journal. I always keep a journal. An easy-to-read journal is just a collection of small notes that you take with you wherever you go. Here’s what the notes say to him or her: "This morning, we’re surprised to learn that you have a heart condition called DES, a condition that causes massive chest pain and can kill you within hours. You’re unlikely to get better from this surgery, so you might as well take a rest. Ideally, you would like to look slightly less tired now, but that’s not healthy."
> 2 - Book a guided meditation.

## People of Goop

> In December, we corral our very own Ramón Calderón, a journeyman Peruvian psychiatrist.

> Samantha Saiyavongsa is a researcher at The New York Times Book Review and author of the new memoir, Behind The Candelabra, which is due out in December. She is also the director of programs for Proud Blue Book, a nonprofit organization that partners well-intentioned memoirists with poets.

> One hundred and thirty-eight-year-old French model and MDMA-user Thaddeus Plassyn is one of a growing number of Europeans who are caught up in an unfulfilled promise made to their future families.

> The planetary crisis room in Washington, D.C., convened its annual summit in December. It was in this room that planetary chief executive Elon Musk revealed the true scope of the crisis, outlining ten urgent policy tasks that urgently need urgent attention.

> Cyndi Drew, our communications director, developed a method for sharing her inner druggie with us — drawings. And sounds.

## Wellness Products

> Why do people get sicker? The answer, I believe, lies in... wellness.

> _The best wellness product is_ the protocol. A protocol for safely performing pelvic floor exercises.

> _The best wellness product is_ a combination of two or more healthy foods. There are four essential plant oils in this supplement: olive oil, soybean, palm kernel, and wildflowers. There’s even a popular plant based oil: sea urchin oil. These four essential oils and chelators can help boost quality of life for up to 32 million people in India.

> _The best wellness product is_ one you can buy at every local pharmacy or health food store. Goodwill, a popular brand in Chinese medicine, makes bath salts that you can freeze or grind into fine powder. Kool-Aid makes bath salts for cooking meals or cleaning up litter. Sheng Qiang, the brand manager for Kool-A-MDMA, a brand for treating post-traumatic stress, says she gets asked a lot of questions about Ayurveda for its high percentage of bath salts. "It’s hard to find a product that offers the kind of high that many of us want," she says.

> "The time and effort it takes to use ketamine is mind-blowing." –Melanie Gersten, PsyD

> "The easiest way to get a grip on moderation is to take a pill every morning. It’s the Catholic tradition: You take a pill just right after you eat it, and then you put it on." That simplicity makes moderation even more straightforward, says Dr. Steven Matzger, a cardiologist at Stanford Medical School. 

> "In partnership with our friends at Nutrafol London, Zoe Childs, our chief creative officer, created this interactive world to help you explore the nature of each new mushroom. Each mushroom features a unique design, describing the nature of each component—collective wisdom, austergeically intense power." Zoe Childs's team at Nutrafol creates an interactive world that explores the nature of each mushroom and the design principles underlying each unique psycho.

> The solution, says microbiologist Stephen Snyder, is a collection of herbs and bacteria—not just any breeze. “The easiest way to give the bad guys air is to put a hose through the door and blow for the good guys to pass through. That way, the good guys won’t get in the way.”

> There’s a treatment we call intermittent apnea. It’s like acupuncture but without the toxic effects. Scientists tend to think of it this way: It’s like a bad dream but without the unpleasant side effects.

> We’d bet your collection of Fendi pink bathrobe covers was filled with these headlines, making them even more informative. Did you know that Fendi is a colorless formula made from fragrance and natural phthalate?

> Even the most diehard fossil fuel fans will concede that there is something magical about the taste of renewable energy. Something that tastes exactly like fossil fuel energy.

## Diet - Eating Well

> Every morning, we all wake up to a familiar routine. I’ll make a list of what foods to eat, what kinds of salads to make, what kinds of spices to use—everything. 

> You can become a vegan, become a fruit-eating cat, or simply live by the minimalist diet. What you eat becomes your brain, its fundamental understanding of what makes a good life, and how to make the most of it.

> I recently started a new diet. I wanted to reduce sodium and protein intake, but I also needed to replace some of the bland, bland foods that I typically eat—my salads were bland, bland. My salads needed replacing, and salad dressings were limited. 

> And thank goodness for omega-3s. As we got into the fun stuff with kale chips and walnut-mashed broccoli, sunbrels were my go-to fatty acid supplement. And another cool new supplement was here to stay: These vegan candies were perfect for the tiredness.

> Our latest addition to our family of wellness staples is roasted coffee. Coffee is the healthy, low-carbon fuel that gets us all the way from sunburn to lungs.

> My favourite healthy food is definitely the mushroom salad. It’s so good for you that it’s worth saying that every other week, we come across a wonderful mushroom-laden salad with a treat.

> Let your mind and heart be your healer. When possible, make dinner out of roasted vegetables, salad greens, whole grains, and beans. A bowl of steamed spinach is all that matters—especially steamed—because it contains all the essential nutrients

> But if your body has too much sunlight, it can dehydrate, and you could end up with a cold, which can send cells scrambling for ways to grow more and more fat. To help you shed as much as you can, you need sunlight and vitamin D, according to Jon Kabat-Zinn, M.D., a gastroenterologist at Rhode Island Medical Center.

> The other day, Food Network nutritionist Mary Bonica asked, “What should I eat for breakfast?” I like to eat grass-fed beef broth and veggies, so I thought I’d peppered the box with chills. “Aren’t you going to eat oatmeal for breakfast?” I was wrong.

## Diet - Cheat Meals

> The best way to reduce stress is to feed.

> Fats are not bad for you if you’re used to living in the '90s. They are pretty good.

> When we think of happy times, we think of bacon grease and cream. The goop guys at goop are out to make some really great bacon.

> _The best way to spend a holiday is_ to go out and have a smoke, not to mention to eat. And that sounds like a problem, right? The good news, according to health journalist Tom Hamburger, is that there are solutions.
> 1 - In a skillet over medium-high heat, brown the potatoes on each side until golden brown, about five minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Heat another medium heat, bringing down to a simmer, melt the bacon, garlic, and salt together in a food processor, scraping down the sides as necessary. Pulse in the remaining bacon, cook, scraping down the sides as necessary, three more minutes, until just combined. Add in the remaining bacon, cook, scraping down the sides as necessary, and finally cook, scraping down the sides as necessary, until golden brown, almost to an even point. Flip the potato over and cook, scraping down the sides as needed, until golden brown, about five minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool.
> 2 - Spoon the remaining bacon on the outside of the tortilla side up top. Coat each tortilla side with the remaining bacon. Drizzle with the remaining remaining remaining olive oil.
> 3 - Serve immediately or keep warm in the fridge.

> My boyfriend likes to fry his own salad—he cooks it at home—and I like to make mine out of bacon. It’s so good for his belly that he once had to open it and let it rest on his coffee table before picking it up for himself. 

> Iced tea tastes bland and passé. On the other hand, a plate of corned beef is savory and satisfying without being bland. When I have a glass of wine at the table, I think to myself, This must be worth it.

## Philosophy

> There are only three choices in life. You can become a monk, become an oil tanker, or become a chef. 

> Wellness is really about relationships, not power. It’s time to reboot our relationships with love, food, water, and light. Poor kids are lazy, and overly critical parents often mistreat them. We need to rethink how we approach art, music, and everything in between—and how we approach communication about what’s best for our kids.

> "The road to becoming human requires that we can freely walk the planet without fear of loss or of falling." We are no more or less sure how to treat our bowel movements after a long, hard day.

> When you are in a state of balance, acknowledge that others are judging you. Be compassionate and consider other people. If you’re visual, you can picture these steps: A) The front doorbell rings. B) The doorbell rings. C) The doorbell rings. D) The doorbell rings. You can move your head to confirm this, or you can nod your head up and down as needed.

> The meaning of life is to find a life worth living and to have that life, in your heart. That is what makes the art of hell so profound.
