## Unsolicited Feedback
# Quip

- Quip is great for collaborative editing
- But the experience of reviewing lots of comments is terrible
- Quip should have an inbox view where you can, paragraph by paragraph, review the items you're tagged to
- Underlying point: it doesn't need to be a single document any more; it's not paper
- This reflects a kind of implicit skeuomorphism, even if it's not as expicit as early iOS Notes app (rich Corinthian leather, etc)
- What are other ways you could improve the UX by letting go of this implicit skeuomorphism?
-- Templatising parts of content, making it easier to insert elsewhere? e.g. having a standard intro that is relied upon by a bunch of other documents
-- Conditional documents: e.g. an onboarding guide where you answer some questions at the top, and the content below adjusts
-- Notion of ownership for parts of a document, then "show me just the parts I own" - useful in very long documents
-- Cf. Prezi - different way of arranging slides to allow for more movement in other directions
-- Is Quip's folder structure or Confluence's sub-page structure optimal for organising? Or neither? Search vs browse - search good if you know what you want...

- What would the use cases be? What would make Quip a killer app for document-heavy teams, say, lawyers?
