# Fuel on the fire?
## Government fossil fuel subsidies in Australia

_6 Jan 2020_

Amid the current bushfire crisis, a message gathering support is that the Australian Government should stop all subsidies to fossil fuel industries. This is fair enough -- fossil fuel companies hardly represent a fledgling industry in need of government assistance to get off the ground, even leaving aside their specific responsibility for environmental damage. I was interested in digging further into exactly how big these subsidies are, and what I found was a bit surprising. 

### $29 billion?

In particular, the figure of $29 billion has been thrown around a bit on social media. For example, Celeste Barber, who kicked off an amazing fundraiser for the Rural Fire Service, posted that, _"Every year, the Australian government gives $29 billion of OUR money to subsidise the coal and gas industries."_ (I want to be absolutely clear that I'm not having a dig at Celeste Barber, who is doing truly great work.)

The source of this $29b figure is a [working paper](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/05/02/Global-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-Remain-Large-An-Update-Based-on-Country-Level-Estimates-46509) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - see Appendix 5. But the way IMF economists define 'subsidies' is a bit different to the common usage. When we say subsidies, we usually mean a direct transfer of funds or tax deductibility, and I think that comes across in Barber's post. For example, the NSW Government subsidises sports for kids by providing $100 vouchers to parents, and the federal government effectively subsidises charity donations or certain corporate R&D investments by making them tax-deductible.

The IMF, however, groups all of those direct subsidies under the label _'pre-tax subsidies'_, and considers them to be pretty minor in relation to what it calls _'post-tax subsidies'_. (You can see more on their [definitions](https://www.imf.org/external/np/fad/subsidies/pdf/note.pdf) if you're keen.) Post-tax subsidies represent the difference between the current price of something, and what the IMF calculates its true 'efficient' price should be, once you account for factors that are not currently reflected in the price. In the case of coal, for example, that means factoring in the medical cost of people getting sick from particulate emissions from mining and burning coal, as well as the environmental and follow-on costs of coal's contribution to climate change. They're more of an implicit subsidy across society. The IMF paper notes that these post-tax subsidies are 15-20 times higher than pre-tax ones, across the world.

The $29 billion figure in the report is all in this 'post-tax' category. There is no actual $29 billion of taxpayer cash that is being transferred to BHP or Woodside each year. Rather, this is an estimate of the additional revenue the government _could_ (or even _should_) be raising on fossil fuels, for example via an emissions trading scheme (ETS). I think an ETS would be a no-brainer good policy to enact, but it's probably a little off-base to cast the lack of an ETS as being the same as a direct cash subsidy from the taxpayer. And unfortunately, the IMF paper doesn't include per-country breakdowns of the direct, 'pre-tax' subsidies.

### $12 billion?

So, what is the actual figure for explicit subsidies to fossil fuels in terms of existing payments or tax deductions?

The environmental group Market Forces suggests the figure of $12 billion, based on [a review]((https://www.marketforces.org.au/campaigns/ffs/tax-based-subsidies/) ) of tax measures in the federal budget. But crucially, they're not coming up with a figure that is just about subsidies to fossil fuel _industries_, but all fossil fuel usage, including consumption.

For example, roughly $7b of the $12b total is from the Fuel Tax Credit Scheme. Market Forces suggests that 80% of that $7b goes to fuel users other than fossil fuel producers (e.g. coal mining companies). But they include the whole $7b figure in their total. You can [argue](https://theconversation.com/viewpoints-should-fuel-tax-credits-be-cut-in-the-budget-25988) about whether fuel tax credits are a sensible policy, but either way we can't really take that whole dollar figure and say it's going to the coal and gas industries. (Separately, the Australia Institute [cites](https://www.tai.org.au/node/451) a total subsidy figure of $10 billion, of which $5 billion is from the Fuel Tax Credit scheme.)

Similarly, many of the other items in the Market Forces table are related to consumer usage of vehicles - e.g. "Fringe Benefits Tax – Application of statutory formula to value car benefits" or "FBT – Alternatives to the logbook method of substantiating car expenses". While these might encourage car usage, and run counter to an appropriately aggressive climate policy, it seems like a stretch to include them as subsidies for fossil fuel industries.

Overall, it seems to me that **maybe $1 - 1.5 billion** of the items in the Market Forces table are tax subsidies actually going to fossil fuel producing industries. That is dominated by the fuel tax credit, which is not uniquely provided to those industries, but also other farming, trucking, mining and so on. Still a significant number, but we're starting to get a long way from the $29 billion we started at.

### What about Adani?

A quick case study on the Adani Carmichael coal mine is interesting, because it brings state government subsidies into the mix (not mentioned above). The environmental group IEEFA [estimates](https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IEEFA-Note_Billionaire-Adani-Being-Subsidised-for-Carmichael-Thermal-Coal-Mine_29-August-2019.pdf) the Adani mine will receive $4.4b of subsidies over its life. The largest components are:
- a multi-year holiday on extraction royalties, worth $0.9b
- approval to avoid paying to rehabilitate the mine sites, worth $1b
- those fuel tax credits again, worth $2.4b

These are the sorts of things that seem fairly egregious, together with the massive water allocation. I appreciate I am asserting this without deeper evidence, but it seems really unclear that providing those direct subsidies for this kind of project is a better use of public funds than the alternatives, if your aim is to generate employment.

### Takeaway

**My key takeaway from this quick research is that trying to remove direct subsidies is OK, but a carbon price / emissions trading scheme is essential. The implicit subsidy in our collective mispricing of carbon emissions (~$29b pa) is so much bigger than the amount we give semi-directly to fossil fuel companies (say ~$1.5b pa, plus a bit more to particular projects like Adani).**

It's tempting to think of fossil fuel producers as scapegoats, and it probably does make sense to remove subsidies so that we don't leave one foot on the accelerator of carbon emissions as we try to put our other foot on the brake. But getting to the IMF's 'efficient' price on fuels will mean we all have to be part of a more accurate system, where we pay more as consumers of carbon-intensive energy, while relying on the spectacular progress in renewable energy to bring overall energy costs down. If just removing subsidies becomes the catch-cry, it won't get us far enough.
