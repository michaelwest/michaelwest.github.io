# How Google Works
## Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg

### Key points from an Amazon review:
1. Crowded work spaces fuel contagious energy and spontaneity; the physical presence of team members matters.
2. Keep management lean, with numerous direct reports per manager to assure leadership is crisp and micro-management rare.
3. Ignorance is not bliss, knowledge is instructive; share virtually everything about the company's business with all employees.
4. Smaller teams for building products; larger to sustain and grow.
5. Deliver transformative products, driven as much or more by insight as evident market demand. PS: platforms with leverage win.
6. Leaders don't delegate hiring; hire smart, curious learners and pay handsomely for impact.
7. Be mindful of your career objectives; sketch the larger ambition, then plan its execution, while remaining smartly opportunistic.
8. Spend 80% of your time on the stuff that generates 80% of your revenues; the new is seductive, but keep your focus balanced.
9. There are only a few truly important messages; assure they are heard: to quote Eric: "repetition doesn't spoil the prayer."
10. It's what you do that counts.


### Teams and culture
- Associate Product Manager program where people rotate through different roles every 12 months.
- Encourage job movement - "We discuss it in our staff meetings and one-on-ones: Who on your team is a good candidate for rotation? Where do they want to go? Do you think that is the best thing for them?"
- Culture and values need to help people make tough decisions.
- Avoid highest paid person's opinion (HIPPO).
- Organise teams around the people who make the most impact.
- On work life balance, give people responsibility and freedom - they will make time to achieve things that they own.
- Marissa Mayer's view is that burnout isn't from working too hard, but giving up things that really matter.
- Important that people are not indispensable, and vacations are a good test of this.
- Vital to lead teams of smart creatives from the front, not behind.

### Products
- Strong products are vital, and are usually based on technical insight rather than market segmentation.
- Don't care too much about the competition. Larry Page: "I feel my job is mostly getting people not to think about the competition. In general I think there's a tendency for people to think about the things that exist. Our job is to think of the thing you haven't thought of yet that you really need. And by definition, if our competitors knew that thing, they wouldn't tell it to us or anybody else."

### Hiring
- Hire "smart creatives" with business savvy, technical knowledge, creative energy, hands-on approach to getting things done.
- Hiring is extremely important for all levels of the company. Similarly, interviewing is an extremely important skill to develop, and requires lots of preparation. A herd effect can bring good people to work with existing good people - you can talk about existing employees to sell.
- Passionate people usually don't use the word passion but can talk at length about their passion topic
- Hire people with learning ability and growth mindset, rather than hiring for existing experience or skills.
- Urgency of role should not compromise quality in hiring.
- Asking somebody about a past mistake (e.g. "What trend did you miss about the internet?") can be useful
- Diversity delivers better results than homogeneity
- Interviews need not be longer than 30 minutes; interview score accuracy levels off after about 5 interviews
- Interviewers must form an opinion and back it with specific data

### Operational culture
- Heavy (probably overstated) bias toward using data to make decisions
- As a leader, make people state their views before you state yours, so that they don't just agree
- Sufficiently important initiatives should be driven with very regular (e.g. daily) meetings to maintain momentum
- Meetings should have a clear owner and agenda to be useful, and should not have more than 8-10 people max
- Avoid multitasking in meetings (sign that you shouldn't be in the meeting)
- Spend 80% of your time on 80% of your revenue - i.e. stay focused on core instead of distraction by shiny new stuff
- 70/20/10 - 70% resources on core, 20% on emerging early success, 10% new high-risk high-return
- A coach can help you
- Default to high transparency in communication
- Snippets are like weekly status reports, and each person can see everyone else's snippets
- Question voting system Dory for use in TGIF meetings - now released as Google Moderator
- Red and green paddles used to show dissatisfaction with a TGIF answer
- Connect new employees with "elders" who have a lot of knowledge
- Innovation cannot be done by fiat or a centralised office
- Mostly about culture of saying yes to ideas and "giving them time and freedom to evolve and live"
- Think big (10X) rather than incrementally
- OKRs used for major objectives and the point is to achieve less than 100% success
- "The [20% time] program doesn't mean that the campus turns into summer camp every Friday, with all the engineers goofing off in (hopefully) creative ways. In fact, 20 percent time is more like 120 percent time, since it often occurs on nights and weekends. ... Regardless of when you take your 20 percent time, assuming it doesn't get in the way of doing your regular job, nobody can stop you doing it."
- Most valuable result is "the things that people learn when they try something new"
- Iteration is vital - products should not be bad at launch, but they can have limited functionality; iterate based on actual usage data
- Learn to fail well - "any failed project should yield valuable technical, user and market insights"
