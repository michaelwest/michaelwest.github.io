# Simple Rules
## Donald Sull and Kathleen Eisenhardt

## Key points
Identify which objective will move the needles (both top line and bottom line)
Identify specific activity or decision that represents a critical bottleneck
Choose rules: boundary, prioritisation, timing, stopping, coordination

## Examples
- Medical triage has specific indicators of injury severity, eg consciousness, pulse rate, breathing rate. Specific rules not just general ideas.
- Burglars pick houses without a car parked in front - reliable proxy for someone at home
- Failure to follow 2pm summit time limit resulted in deaths on Everest
- Swallow, locust and bee swarms follow simple coordination rules
- Most successful tech companies stay at the "edge of chaos" - Netflix hiring and expense policies
- A study compared 109 legal systems: the ones with more rules limiting judges were perceived as less just by citizens and took longer to deliver results in simple cases such as evicting a delinquent tenant.
- Oakland A's changed their rules as Moneyball was copied; came up with new concepts like picking players who did very well in only one situation and then applying them to that situation. Need to respond to disruption with new rules to stay ahead.
- Counter-example of complex rules: US tax code at 3.8M words. U.S. employs 1.2M tax preparers, more than total of police and firefighters.


## Implementation
Get people to agree on the rules for prioritising activity, rather than just fighting out which activity to pursue, to improve their buy-in with any cuts. Example: trimming underperforming programs at a business school. Can also have thresholds of rules for auto pass, auto fail, and manual review.

Without thought on rules, default to poor easy heuristics like what is normal or what is easily available (Thinking Fast and Slow) e.g. non adjacent customers may be similar amount of effort but much larger growth potential. Simple rules can also help people avoid falsely attributing importance to distracting info that is actually not important.

Regular reflection on activities in context of rules improves understanding of causality, allowing rules to be improved. Keep a journal. Experts tend to use more abstract rule sets than novices; not one size fits all.
