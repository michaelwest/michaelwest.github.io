### Plato
- People should pursue _eudaimonia_ - fulfilment rather than constant happiness
- People should think more carefully about their lives, as intuition and 'common sense' are often wrong - comparable to being dragged by blindfolded wild horses.
- Beautiful objects and architecture give us a sense of the good, and invite us to evolve in that direction too.
- Societies should: look up to the right people (modest, experienced, charitable); censor demagoguery; educate children in how to be good people, not just in facts; play an active role in raising children.

### Aristotle
- Virtue ethics: people should aim to cultivate distinct virtues that lie at a 'golden mean' between extremes. For example: Rashness < Courage > Cowardice; Shyness < Modesty > Shamelessness. Building virtues takes time and deliberate practice.
- A role of tragic art is to remind us that bad things happen to good people like ourselves, so we should have more compassion.
- True friendship is very valuable: shared joy, sorrows.
- Rhetoric and persuasion: necessary to soothe fears and help people make sacrifices by understanding their emotions. To be effective, cater to short attention spans, using lively illustration and examples.

### Stoics, incl. Seneca & Marcus Aurelius
- To address anxiety, don't try to persuade yourself (or another) that the worst case won't happen; instead assume that it will, but realise that you will cope anyway.
- Practise living through a bad situation to realise you will survive: e.g. for a week, sleep on a hard floor and eat stale bread.
- Expect disappointment and tragedy so that they make you sad, but not angry too. _"What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears."_
- Fortuna, goddess of luck and fortune, has an important influence on life. Recognise this, instead of assuming the permanence of your current situation, or a false meritocracy.

### Epicurus
- Working on something fulfilling - helping others, in a small group - is more important than money. Dreams of luxury are a misplaced search for internal calm, but calm comes from having time to self-reflect and understand our internal worries.
- Friendships are reliable sources of happiness, as people are more likely to seek agreement and avoid jealousy, in comparison to romantic relationships.
- He established a commune with friends so they could see each other frequently, work together on low-paid but satisfying projects, and spend time on self-reflection. Influenced monasteries and Marxist communism.

### Augustine
- He challenged the Roman orthodoxy of living in a just, meritocratic society where earthly wealth was evidence of ability and virtue.
- All humans are erratic, lustful and mad due to original sin; we are undermined by pride, lust and irrationality. (Even without agreeing on original sin, this idea of imperfection is useful.)
- All societies are unjust; only the 'City of God' is fair. _"True justice has no existence save in that republic whose founder and ruler is Christ."_
- So failure and poverty should be met with compassion, and success and riches with some scepticism.

### Thomas Aquinas
- In his time, pre-Christian thinking, even on natural sciences, was usually rejected due to the paganism of its originators; he challenged this.
- Distinguished between 'natural law' - parts of the world we can understand by experience, experiment and reasoning - and 'eternal law' - that can only be known by divine revelation. The two are separate.
- More generally, treat ideas on their own merits instead of assuming correct ideas can only come from certain anointed sources.

### Michel de Montaigne
- Philosophers are unreasonable in focusing on reason's ability to overcome basic instincts: _"Our life consists partly in madness and partly in wisdom; whoever writes about it merely respectfully and by rule leaves half of it behind."_
- Everyday lives are worthy of praise: _"Rebuking, laughing, buying, selling, loving, hating and living together justly and gently"_ is as impressive as _"glittering deeds"_.
- Living a good life is not restricted to Platonic super-beings, but to all, and philosophical writing and instruction should therefore be broad and accessible.

### Spinoza
- God is not personal. There is no entity to hear prayers, perform miracles, or inflict judgement.
- But God does exist as an abstract concept: the 'eternal cause', natural laws, the idea of truth, and so on. The task of humans is to come closer to God by seeking to understand the universe and living peacefully within it.
- Few people were convinced by Spinoza, partly because he sought to remove religious traditions and rituals that are actually valuable and comforting.

### Schopenhauer
- In all people there is a 'will to life' that drives us to find a partner and reproduce. 
- Much human suffering is because we assume life (and our desires) are arranged to make us happy, rather than simply to reproduce (or perhaps more generally, following our fallible biology.)
- 'Sages' (effectively monks) may overcome this drive by living in seclusion; for most people, contact with art and philosophy is the nearest approach.

### Hegel
- Every era of history clearly manifests some ideas that we may have lost in the present, and should refer back to even if much else was wrong, e.g. community in ancient Greece or honour in the Middle Ages.
- Threatening ideas may contain worthy elements worth salvaging, e.g. nationalism contains elements of geographic belonging and identity beyond the self.
- Progress is a messy process with significant backsliding and overreaction, leading to a pendulum between thesis, counter-thesis and finally a more useful synthesis.
- Art should assist with the sensuous, impactful presentation of useful ideas, rather than being 'for art's sake' or in coming up with especially new, shocking ideas.
- For ideas to have impact, they must be nurtured and reinforced by building institutions around them, e.g. the Church to spread the ideas of Jesus.

### Nietzsche
- _"God is dead"_ - not celebratory, but an argument that even without religious belief, people require ritual, art and community to help them live better. Academies should aim to make these accessible.
- Great outcomes may require great struggle, but various 'opiates' can interfere (e.g. religion encouraging people to settle for obedience and purity; alcohol encouraging numbness).
- Envy is natural in a society that thinks of itself as egalitarian, even if it isn't really. But envy can be instructive, as it reveals a part of our full potential that we aren't meeting - reflect on envy in detail.
