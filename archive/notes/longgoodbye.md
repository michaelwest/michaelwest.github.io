# Quarterly Essay: Long Goodbye
## Anna Krien

- In 2016, National Coral Bleaching Taskforce found that only 7% of Great Barrier Reef had been completely spared bleaching. Over 65% of the northern reef is now dead.
- Mining sector accounts for 7% of GDP and 2% of employment. Much of the profit and income goes offshore.
- In 2016, Qld state mining royalties were $1.59 billion, 3% of state revenue and slightly less than car registrations at $1.63 billion. But can vary from year to year and hopes for $3 billion this year. Royalty holidays and publicly-funded infrastructure help to subsidise some projects.
- Indigenous community corporations are subject to heavy external influence; e.g. mining companies setting up rival community groups that bus in families from other areas. Tribunal can only grant leases, not ban them indefinitely, so there is little incentive for mining companies to concede.
- Claims in Australia that exporting Australian coal to India will help lift many out of poverty (especially energy poverty). However, India is not approving new coal power plants and is pushing to have 60% renewables by 2027. Even Adani is building large solar plants there.
- Water use in Qld is not controlled effectively. Farmers reliant on Great Artesian Basin. But CSG wells use 22% of water and do not require licences at all, while Adani's proposed large mine has been granted unlimited water use rights.
- Electricity industry profits rose 67% between 07-08 and 10-11, and electricity bills rose 40%. NSW and Qld had largest increases, and have lowest renewables and largest over-investment in infrastructure. ACT is on track for 100% renewable energy by 2020 and has lowest household energy bills.
- PM Turnbull and Minister Matt Canavan both called for ultra-super-critical coal plants to be built in Qld. But CS Energy, Qld's main electricity supplier, has no intention of further coal plan construction.
- 1.5M houses in Australia have solar panels on roofs.
