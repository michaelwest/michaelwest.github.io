# Nudge
## Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein

Basically: humans' cognitive shortcuts cause them to make mistakes; they are likely to adhere to a default or to go with a peer choice, especially when feedback is weak or the mapping from value to outcome is hazy. This knowledge can be used to structure choices ('choice architecture'), hopefully in ways that help the person.

* N: incentives
* U: understand mappings from choice to value (easy: ice-cream, hard: superannuation)
* D: defaults
* G: give feedback
* E: expect errors
* S: structure complex choices

Auto-enrolment vs making people set themselves up. "Save more tomorrow" to avoid loss aversion.

Opt-out > simple opt-in > forced choice > complex opt-in. Organ donations as example.
Other defaults eg placement of food in cafeteria.

Give understandable feedback on how choices map to eventual value, especially if user is making bad choices - superannuation. Feedback in digestible form, including peer feedback - eg electricity bill with average neighbour consumption and smiley/frown face. Often feedback is invisible or not transparent so people stay on autopilot.

Notable that Australia has implemented some key points already - superannuation vs 401k, pre-filled tax refund.
