## Unsolicited Feedback
# Confluence and Jira

## Confluence
- Immediacy, staleness: type to edit, not edit mode
- How do you get info to the person who needs it, when they need it? Rather than having simultaneous large mass of hard-to-explore info, while people are reinventing the wheel?

## Jira
- Usability vs configurability (there are always way too many fields) - why is it a tradeoff instead of config improving usability? Are many instances misconfigured - and if so why, maybe poor defaults, limited setup support -- cf "concierge onboardings" that are all the rage
- Heavyweight vs lightweight competitors - should there be a simple checkbox mode? What's the right balance vs apps like Linear? What has changed in new Jira?
- Absorption of add-on plugins
- How do people actually use Jira? Backwards? Plan separately, then enter tasks and updates later? Is it the real source of truth?
- How can you use it under pressure? Why do people revert to very simple methods like whiteboards? Related to simplicity.
