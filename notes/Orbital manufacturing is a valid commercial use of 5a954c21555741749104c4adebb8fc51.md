It seems like there are a range of products that could make economic sense to manufacture in low Earth orbit, taking advantage of zero gravity and perfect vacuum.

Products might be manufactured either for:

**Use in space:**

- Satellite and spacecraft components and spare parts

- Large structures that are cheaper to make in space than transport from Earth, e.g. telescope panels that would otherwise require a complex folding geometry for launch

 

**Return to Earth** â€” extremely high-value products requiring zero-g or vacuum:

- Materials: fibre optic strands, semiconductor afers

- Biomedical: printed organs, implants

- Pharmaceuticals

This is economically enabled by much cheaper launch. In Case for Space, Zubrin estimates that LEO launch cost will get down to $200/kg, making products sold at $2000/kg viable after accounting for various overheads.

Only LEO manufacturing seems to make sense for now. Later, but much more speculatively:

- Moon manufacturing may be useful for large-scale vacuum processes, or returning products that are made in lunar orbit back to Earth.
- Mars manufacturing may be useful for supplying asteroid mining stations.
