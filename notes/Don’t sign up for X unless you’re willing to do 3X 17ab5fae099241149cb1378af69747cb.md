When building a software product, it can be tempting to commit to adding a requested feature because it seems like it will only need a small effort to do so. But apparently small efforts usually balloon, immediately disrupting the original value calculus. 

Ways this can happen include:

1. **Immediate follow-on feature requests**, as the user sees the feature MVP and gets new ideas, or realises that their original idea of the MVP wasn't actually sufficient.
2. **Follow-on impacts on other parts of the system**, as the user thinks about how the feature will impact their end-to-end workflow. For example, if the new feature allows the collection of some new type of data, the user realises a subsequent need for other tools to analyse or export the data.
3. **Ongoing sustainment costs**, in terms of future engineering effort to maintain the code for the feature (e.g. checking it still works through future upgrades to the codebase).
4. **Ongoing drag** where the added features make it harder to deprecate applications or APIs in order to evolve the broader platform.

**Operationalise:** If you are thinking, "*this is worth doing as long as it only takes X effort or less*", pause. Would it be worth doing if it actually took 3X effort? Because it probably will. 

Even better, though not always realistic, is to find and focus on the items that would be worthwhile even if they took 10X effort, because they're so fundamentally valuable to the user. In this regard, see:
