- Shift from individual subsistence agriculture to centralised agriculture enabled more people to spend time doing other things
- What things are currently handled in a subsistence-like way, with many people struggling to do it on their own?
    - Care work (huge nuance: people may want to do this for obvious emotional reasons, but there could still be more support)
    - Routine housework
    - Groceries, meal planning
- Is our society too atomised?
