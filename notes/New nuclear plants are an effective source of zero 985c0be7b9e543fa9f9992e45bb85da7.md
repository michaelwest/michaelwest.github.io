- Some people think that nuclear is not a necessary part of a low-carbon energy mix
- Newer plant models, especially small modular reactors, are likely to be cheaper and safer than prior models, eg zero-human safety

- Recent large nuclear plants have been expensive largely due to soft factors such as regulation costs and low productivity - could be improved by  more adaptive regulation (eg acknowledging smaller exclusion zone footprint around a safer small reactor) and more manufacturing-oriented approach of multiple small reactors rather than one-off mega project construction
