### Arguments

1. Sci-fi of the last ~20 years is mostly pessimistic in tone about technology whereas there was more optimistic sci-fi in the mid-20th century.
2. Optimistic sci-fi provides examples of futures in which there has been a definite positive change. The specific visions of technology can rally people to deliver those, but also, these reinforce the underlying basic idea that definite changes should be conceived and executed (rather than indefinite, incremental, financialised progress).
3. Optimistic sci-fi provides inspiring, individual role models for pursuing technical careers. 
4. Journalism, literature and entertainment provide a valid critical role — not all technology is positive, not all technical founders are heroes.
5. This argument is not meant to be universal. There was dystopian sci-fi in the past (eg Brave New World) and there are optimistic presentations of technology in the present. But the dominant mood does feel different to the 1950s (or 1850s!)

### Visions of positive futures

- ***Thunderbirds***:
    - Core idea of a high-tech organisation delivering a critical civic good to the world, altruistically rather than for profit or exploitation.
    - Background plots reflect ambitious technology and infrastructure: nuclear-powered irrigation of African and Australian deserts, Fireflash hypersonic airliner, Sun Probe rocket mission, Highway Delva construction. Of course, the point of Thunderbirds is that many of these have problems (though often due to sabotage), but the technical ambition is still there and the crises are not portrayed as illustrating technical hubris.
- ***Star Trek***:
    - Post-scarcity society, liberal values
    - Emphasis on exploration and expanding frontiers ("Wagon Train to the Stars") rather than just zero-sum combat a la Star Wars
- **Literature**:
    - Arthur C. Clarke: Project Spaceguard (*Rendezvous with Rama)*, space elevator (*Fountains of Paradise*), general space infrastructure and normalisation of progress in spaceflight; counterpoint that HAL in 2001 is the original "bad AI"
    - Not just the 50s-60s:

- **Advertising** and mass-media that incorporated specific positive visions of technical progress; World's Fair showcases as examples

- Britain during Industrial Revolution had a vibe of definite optimism: *"Recollect farther, that every natural and every artificial advantage is susceptible of gradual progression, and trace the yearly elevation to higher perfection. New societies for improvement …, new machines to advance our arts and facilitate labour; waste lands enclosed, roads improved, bridges erected, canals cut, tunnels excavated, marshes drained and cultivated, docks formed, ports enlarged: these and a thousand kindred operations which present themselves spontaneously to the mind’s eye, prove that we have not yet attained our zenith, and open an exquisite prospect of future stability and greatness."*

**Present situation**

- Sci-fi is largely **pessimistic** about technology: Terminator, The Matrix, Avatar, Elysium, Gravity, Snow Crash, etc
    - Interesting to consider whether environmentalism has ended up being implicitly oppositional to technology — in validly shining a light on failures of industrial companies, did that undermine society's faith in the general mission of those companies? Similar perhaps to Watergate permanently reducing trust in politics and thus big visions in political space.
- (Asserted without proof...) Much tech media content is either negative takedowns or breathless marketing about relatively low-impact tech (digital apps)
- Young people making use of social platforms to promote positive visions of hard technology

- Longform marketing by tech companies could play a role in illustrating new fields, such as Ginkgo Bioworks’ “Grow” magazine:

- Emergence of utopian solarpunk to rival dystopian cyberpunk. But so far most solarpunk stories are pretty amateurish and don’t compete with high-quality works like Snow Crash, Neuromancer, Blade Runner.

- One way to do this is via world building of example futures, in a quasi-documentary format. “How It’s Made” for an orbital hotel or floating city.

### Visions of technical role models

In addition to the visions of society improved by technology, media can also shape perceptions of technical leaders and help determine whether they are seen as inspirational and worthy of emulation, or not — e.g. power-hungry, self-absorbed, net-negative for society.

- Coverage of modern technical leaders is often frictional or focused on the takedown. (It would be interesting to assess the actual numbers here.) *The Social Network* invented a whole fictional plot around Zuckerberg building the platform out of envy after being rejected by a woman, when in fact he dated the same woman from before he founded Facebook and later married her.
    - Note that although the depiction of Zuckerberg is fairly negative, apparently the film has been cited as having a positive effect on inspiring people to launch startups.

- Repurposing old archetypes for modern technologies may be useful:

- **Astronauts**: It's unfortunate that we are still having to look nostalgically at mid-century for heroic images - e.g. Disney+ *The Right Stuff* series focused on the Mercury astronauts - while modern-day space stories are fictional - e.g. Netflix *Away* Mars mission series. *The Martian* is a good example of a narrative that highlights the value of technical problem solving - that the book had to be self-published perhaps illustrates the reduced appetite for these stories.

- **Marvel**: looking at some of the most influential pop-culture heroes, most of them have innate abilities, rather than making progress through technology and work. The obvious and important exception is Iron Man. An interesting aspect of Iron Man however is the self-focus of his technology — he is generally building an arsenal for his own use, even if for altrustic purposes, rather than providing this technology outwards to the world. (Note: Thunderbirds is the same.)

    In this scene, Iron Man installs an arc reactor with a mention of clean energy but it’s only for the use of his own building. Why not the whole city? His technology is presented as something basically as alien and inaccessible as the mystic powers of the other superheroes.

    [https://youtu.be/vWFXrln0we8](https://youtu.be/vWFXrln0we8)

    An interesting point in the overall Marvel context: Iron Man is ultimately not there to build a utopian future where everyone has clean energy, but rather to die in service of protecting Earth from attack and really just maintaining the status quo ante. Samo Burja contrasts Chinese and American culture in this way:

- Interestingly I'm not sure that golden-age sci-fi is particularly full of inspirational role models either. The characterisation in say, Arthur C. Clarke's novels, is often rather thin and secondary to the overall plot: Dave Bowman in *2001* is more of a symbol for humanity than a heroic technical leader on his own.
- Going further back to 1800s Britain in the Industrial Revolution, scientific and engineering role models were vital in encouraging working people to invest in their education and upskilling. A real sense of agency and potential, not just being left behind by technology.
