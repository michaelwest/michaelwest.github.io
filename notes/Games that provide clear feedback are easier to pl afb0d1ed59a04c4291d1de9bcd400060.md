# Games that provide clear feedback are easier to play

Some games provide only indirect cues on whether the player's approach is working:

- ???

Some provide clear feedback:

- Cities Skylines: residents tweet if they're missing something, clear icons for lack of power or water
- Anno: residents have a pie chart of needs showing whether they are filled up
- Banished gets much easier once you can see the charts of food, firewood etc over time

It is much easier to take action on the latter.

If making the software easier is the goal (usually true for enterprise software, not always true for games), then find ways to provide more direct feedback.

To consider: what does "player's approach" mean in enterprise software context?
