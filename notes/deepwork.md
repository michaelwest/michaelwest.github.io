# Deep Work
## Cal Newport

_Despite this underdone notes page, I found this book very useful and consciously schedule 'deep work' time now._

What is deep work? Deep work is cognitively demanding, hard to do and to replicate. It requires intense concentration. Deep work is required to thrive in modern economy because there is more global competition (“superstars”, eg DHH) and more dominance of difficult fields like software (“high-skill workers”, eg Nate Silver). Deep work is applicable to almost all jobs. To thrive you must be able to learn hard things quickly (eg programming), and to produce high quality work consistently and quickly.

Deep work is rare, because many trends lead to shallow work: open plan seating, IMs/real time collab software, social media presence. Deep work is not necessarily obvious in metrics.

Four disciplines of execution for deep work:
1. Focus on wildly important.
2. Act on lead measures not just lag measures (eg track deep work hours).
3. Keep a visible scoreboard. 
4. Create cadence of accountability (eg weekly review).

When thinking about network tools (eg Twitter): take a craftsman approach where you only use them if benefits actually outweigh costs, not just “any benefit”.

Give some deliberate thought to your leisure time so you use it in less distracting ways than just hanging around on social media / infotainment.
