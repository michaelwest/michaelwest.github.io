## Cognitive Surplus
_Clay Shirky_

Across developed economies, there is roughly a trillion hours of spare time per year. This is "cognitive surplus" available after working to meet everyday needs. Previously, this time has been spent on passive activities such as watching television. Increasingly, the internet is enabling it to be put to use in creative or community-driven activities.

Groups emerging in these ways can be equal or superior to traditionally organised groups. Examples include sites like Wikipedia, Ushahidi, and Josh Groban's charity-driven fanbase. Even meaningless creation, such as lolcats, is viewed by Shirky as better than non-creative activities, because it is still creation.

## The Wisdom of Crowds
_James Surowiecki_

The average estimate of a large number of people is often better than the estimate of a small number of experts. Two examples given are estimating (1) the weight of a cow at a country fair, and (2) the position of a sunken submarine.	

## The Unwinding
_George Packer_

Covers the decline of the middle class and institutional framework of the United States over the last 40 years, by tracking five main stories: Tammy Thomas, a factory worker turned community organiser in the declining factory town Youngstown; Jeff Connaughton, a Washington insider witnessing the rise of lobbying; Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley; Dean Price, a struggling rural biofuel entrepreneur; and Tampa, a heartland of the subprime crisis.

A major theme is the detrimental impact of the financialisation of the US economy, in terms of hollowing out places like Youngstown via manufacturing closures; enabling the subprime crisis by repackaging debts in ways that shifted and concealed major risks; and having a corrupting influence on policymaking.

A memorable quote, from the profile of Raymond Carver: "He seemed to know, in the unintentional way of the fiction writer, that country's future would be most unnerving in its very ordinariness, in the late-night trip to the supermarket, the yard sale at the end of the line. He sensed that beneath the surface of life there was nothing to stand on."

## The New New Thing
_Michael Lewis_

A biography of entrepreneur Jim Clark, supposedly the first person to found three separate billion-dollar companies: Silicon Graphics, Netscape, and Healthscape (later WebMD). He grew up poor but developed very ambitious visions of how to reshape significant parts of the economy, in an archetypal Silicon Valley way, and succeeded to some extent in realising them. He was also an early driver of the practice of rewarding engineers with substantial equity, instead of allowing financiers to take most of the profits.	

## The Innovator's Solution
_Clay Christensen_

Following on from the Innovator's Dilemma, Christensen discusses how most businesses fail to achieve sustained growth, because they do not carefully plan how to build an engine for generating new disruptive businesses. These businesses should have independent resourcing, and be hungry for profit (so that they can stand alone and not have resources stripped by the rest of the organisation) but patient for growth (so that they can find the right product-market fit). Not clear how this applies to being a disruptive business yourself.	

## Boomerang
_Michael Lewis_

Essays on the financial crisis, outside of Wall Street.
- Iceland, a sudden increase in investment banking, without any collective experience, driven to some extent by an aggressive culture.
- Greece, public servants overpaid for low performance, and tax fraud as a way of life.
- Ireland, reckless loans to property developers, at one point leading to as much housing being under construction in Ireland as the rest of the UK (which has 10x more people).
- Germany, which didn't have a bubble at home, but whose banks invested very badly overseas, buying up large amounts of the poor deals engineered (to fail) by sophisticated US banks.
- US states, especially California, whose enormous debts largely driven by public pensions are squeezing out other services.

## Beyond the Boom
_John Edwards_

Australia's mining boom has not had as large an influence on Australia's economy as many claim. Growth on many measures was about the same in 1992-2002 as it was during the boom years (ie high export prices) of 2002-2012, even excluding the impact of the GFC. Apparent boom in Australia's GDP and wages was heavily due to changes in exchange rate against US dollar; measuring in PPP reduces the impact. Because Australia's mining industry is about 80% foreign owned, and mining is capital intensive (profit = 4x wages, vs profit = 2x wages in the wider economy), also reduced amount of economic impact here. For $100 mining value added after expenses, wages $20, state royalties $6, federal tax $14, foreign shareholders $48, Australian shareholders $12. Much of current federal deficit problems are due to cuts to personal income tax made when high company tax disguised the weakness of that revenue structure. During the boom, Australians also saved more, became more educated, and worked more than outside the boom, rather than wasting the inflow of income.	

## The Second Machine Age
_Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee_

- Inflection point in 1750 with steam engine. Almost no economic, social or population growth for previous 400 years.
- Exponential progress of Moore's Law not just in processing power but related areas like storage, chip energy efficiency, network speed
- Recent progress due to (1) Moore's Law, (2) Digitisation -> big data, (3) Recombinant innovation	

## The Name of God is Mercy
_Pope Francis_

- "pardon is the instrument placed into our fragile hands to attain serenity of heart. To let go of anger, wrath, violence and revenge are necessary conditions to living joyfully."
- "whatever you did for these least brothers of mine, you did for me" Matthew 25:40
- "Corruption is not an act but a condition, a personal and social state in which we become accustomed to living. The corrupt man is so closed off and contented in the complacency of his self-sufficiency that be does not allow himself to be called into question by anything or anyone. The self-confidence he has built up is based on a fraudulent behaviour: he spends his life taking opportunistic shortcuts at the cost of his own and others' dignity."

## Wind Sand and Stars
_Antoine de Saint-Exupery_

"The earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books in the world, because it is resistant to us. Self-discovery comes when man measures himself against an obstacle. To attain it, he needs an implement. He needs a carpenter's plane, or a plough. Little by little, as he walks behind the plough, the farmer forces out a few of nature's secrets, and the truth which he uncovers is universal. In the same way the aeroplane, the implement of the airline companies, brings man face to face with all the old problems."

Memorable scenes:
- Sitting on the pre-dawn airfield bus with bureaucrats.
- Comrade flying among Atlantic waterspouts like pillars of a temple.
- Comrade walking down from the Andes after crash-landing.
- Crash-landing on top of a Sahara mesa, previously untouched, and finding small meteorites across it.
- Being unable to distinguish between stars in the sky and lights on the ground, while flying in the pitch black desert at night.
- Providing an old servant/slave with freedom by buying him from owners.
- Crashing in Egypt and surviving for days with very little water: extreme hardship.

## On Tyranny
_Timothy Snyder_

1. Do not obey in advance
2. Defend institutions: actively choose one to support
3. Beware the one-party state: support multi-party democracy, vote
4. Take responsibility for the face of the world: remove symbols of hate
5. Remember professional ethics
6. Be wary of paramilitaries, including violent rallies
7. Be reflective if you are armed (or part of the state apparatus); more Nazi killing was done by regular policemen than by the SS
8. Stand out; people must individually and uncomfortably resist for change to occur - e.g. Rosa Parks, people who assisted those in the ghettos
9. Be kind to language; do not repeat common phrases, but think about them yourself, and prefer books to the internet - cf. Orwell newspeak, Fahrenheit 451
10. Believe in truth, not a post-fact world - cf. Orwell doublethink
11. Investigate; spend more time on long-form, investigative reading
12. Make eye contact and small talk to support people who may feel excluded
13. Practise 'corporeal politics'; show up in the public square, don't just be online
14. Establish a private life; be careful of online presence
15. Contribute to good causes and participate in civil society, even non-political clubs that assist in establishing trust beyond immediate friends and family
16. Learn from peers in other countries; maintain international relationships
17. Listen for dangerous words: 'extremism', 'emergency', 'exceptional times'
18. Do not fall for unnecessary powers seized in the wake of attacks (Reichstag fire)
19. Be a patriot
20. Be courageous
"In politics, being deceived is no excuse" - Leszek Kolakowski

## City of Fortune
_Roger Crowley_

(A history of Venice focused on the Fourth Crusade.)
* Lack of arable land meant no feudal class based on extracting labour from peasants; instead noble influence grew from entrepreneurial merchant ventures.
* Strong central/communal control unlike libertarian Genoa. Heavy coordination and regulations on trade routes (prices and timing), ambassadors, etc. Large ships owned by state but leased to merchants. Annual routes to Egypt etc enabled reliability of supply which encouraged other merchants to buy in Venice.
* Fourth Crusade destined for Jerusalem but diverted into sacking Constantinople as part of internal Byzantine struggle. Chaotic siege with towers built on ships assaulting the sea wall; charge led by 90 year old blind doge Dandolo. Pope had excommunicated the crusaders but leaders didn't tell the troops.
* Venetian colonial empire on Crete, Cyprus, far edge of Black Sea with Mongols, etc. Stuck to ports rather than pushing inland in say Greece. In Mamluk Egypt, practiced consistent diplomacy.
* Wars with Genoa almost led to downfall including one that came right to the lagoon. European and Byzantine infighting allowed gradual rise of Ottomans who, by conducting combined land-sea operations against ports, were able to take over territory and squeeze out Venice's stronger navy.

## How to Operate
_Keith Rabois_

- Leader's role as an editor, not a writer. Red pen - cut things out, simplify. Only focus on 2-4 things that really matter. Goal over time is to use less red ink.
- Delegate - hard to walk between abdicating and micro-managing. Task-relevant maturity - give people more leeway when they have done the task before. Management style needs to be dictated by employee in a task rather than by your own 'style'. Alternatively, think about 2x2 of consequence and conviction - step in at high-consequence, high-conviction; and explain why.
- Most companies expect that hiring more engineers will improve throughput, but it doesn't. Most people are 'ammunition', but you need more people who are 'barrels'. A barrel can take an idea through conception to shipping. You want to expand scope of responsibilities gradually until you see where it breaks.
- Insist on focus. Thiel - each person should do only one thing. Everyone rebelled. Focus until you conquer a problem - otherwise people will solve the B+ problems they understand how to solve, rather than the A+ ones they don't. Metrics and transparency, via a dashboard, that defines business success. Do employees actually use this dashboard?

## Amazon 2016 shareholder letter
_Jeff Bezos_

- Customer obsession, because their dissatisfaction drives product forward
- Resist proxies, like metrics/focus groups as opposed to deep understanding (cf Thiel's 'secret' - could anyone build this based on simply following metrics, or does it embody a secret)
- Embrace external trends like ML
- High-velocity decision-making, eg simple approval for reversible decisions, make decisions with 70% not 95% of necessary info, use concept of "disagree and commit", escalate disputes that are base on misalignment in objectives or worldview.

## Creation and consumption
_Benedict Evans_

[Original](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/7/13/creation-and-consumption)
Don't think of capability in the abstract or as 'technically possible' for power users - has to be truly accessible to be useful and valuable. Cf Marissa Mayer's "big green photocopier button". And then consider how it goes if you use ML or other behind-the-scenes technology to proactively push things to people rather than requiring them to know how to pull those things out of the system.

> "It seems to me that when people talk about what you "can't" do on a device, there are actually two different meanings of "can't" in computing. There is "can't" as meaning the feature doesn't exist, and there is "can't" as meaning you don't know how to do it. If you don't know how to do it, the feature might as well not be there. So, there is what an expert can't do on a smartphone or tablet that they could do on a PC. But then there are all of the things that a normal person (the other 90% or 95%) can't do on a PC but can do on a smartphone, because the step change in user interface abstraction and simplicity means that they know how to do it on a phone and didn't know how to do it on a PC. That is, the step change in user interface models that comes with the shift from Windows and Mac to iOS and Android is really a shift in the accessibility of capability. A small proportion of people might temporarily go from can to can't, but vastly more go from can't to can."

## Reith Lecture - Hilary Mantel - History
- History is not a rehearsal, it was its own main event — does not exist just to provide parallels, and doesn't repeat exactly enough for parallels to be useful.
- We often want to interpret history in ways that are convenient - e.g. to empower women who weren't truly empowered at the time; to have a more gruesome past (the Iron Maiden is a fiction); or to have a 'simpler' one. In reality historical societies were of course complex.

## Reith Lecture - Bertrand Russell - Social cohesion
- People's attitudes to individuality vs social cohesion are mostly biologically unchanged since hunter-gatherer times. Close small-group relationships and suspicion of others outside the small group. Sustaining large groups requires a common outsider.
- It is important to have venues for safe competition - sports, business, other endeavours - that enable an outlet for these inbuilt tendencies.

## Reith Lecture - John Galbraith - Market economy
- Although it is said that consumers have the central role in determining what is produced in a free market economy, many parts of our economies are actually more like planned economies, with the planning decisions happening inside major corporations.
- In particular, there are areas where the state heavily subsidises new technology and in these areas, there is a very hazy line between 'public' and 'private' sectors. This may lead in turn to public policy being set more by the demands of the private companies than by legitimate public purposes; for example, government deciding to invest in a certain kind of weapon because a certain company would like to produce it. In short, the military-industrial complex.

## Reith Lecture - Leon Bagrit - Automation
- Automation is to be welcomed: higher productivity means more goods for everyone.
- Displaced workers may not align with unfilled jobs, so retraining (not just a good general education) is needed. Workers may need “as many as three different kinds of jobs” in their lifetime.
- “With automation, the wages of those working could be raised, taxation could deal with the necessary social adjustments, and low costs and prices would largely solve distribution problems.“

## Reith Lecture - Stephen Hawking - Black holes
- “Black holes don’t have hair” - coined by John Wheeler - the only information you can know about a black hole is its mass, rotation, and charge; which means there are many different ways a given black hole could have come about.
- Falling into a black hole causes spaghettification - in a large hole, event horizon is outside the point where you’d be stretched, so you could make it inside without much trouble.
- Hawking radiation: pairs of particle-antiparticle are popping into existence frequently and usually annihilate, but at event horizon, one may be on one side and the other may escape. Not observed experimentally yet.

## Reith Lecture - Niall Ferguson - Civil society
- Civil society institutions are preferable to formal centralised government.
- Civil society participation has declined since 70s (Bowling Alone) - volunteering, participating in local schools, etc. Figures possibly disputed. Participation lower in working class and multi ethnic communities.
- Educational institutions suffer when there is a monopoly (ie public) rather than competing in a market. There should be more private schools in the West; private schooling is 3x higher in key Asian countries (25%) vs UK/US (7%). More private schooling actually reduces spending on education; he claims due to efficiency. Vital to have good schools to create opportunity; privatisation a way to do so.

## Reith Lecture - Michael Sandel - Moral markets
- Moral limits of markets. Sense that markets have become detached from public value/s.
- Market triumphalism: Reagan/Thatcher years with aggressive market focus, followed by consolidation under market-friendly neoliberalism of Clinton/Blair. Drifted from "having a market economy" to "being a market society".
- “Greed critique” - idea that markets have failed because bankers, politicians etc got too greedy; but greed in markets is expected, so this isn't really a valid critique.
- Rather must consider which parts of society really should/not be touched  by markets eg private military contractors, aggressive pharma marketing, paying students for good test results, paying other countries to take refugees. What if they provide better outcomes for those people - are they then moral?
- Markets can crowd out non-market norms, eg childcare centre fine for late pickups as people just pay the fine and treat it as a fee.
- “Market-mimicking governance” - eg cost benefit analysis - is dangerous because (1) not all things can be captured with a monetary value, eg human life; (2) it is spuriously precise despite being hugely sensitive to input assumptions; (3) so a pseudoscientific approach privileges technocrats instead of democratic deliberation. Example of smoking being net positive to treasury.
- Inequality can be fed by market-focused governance, as wealthy turn to private alternatives (schools, transport, security) and disengage from public.

## Reith Lecture - Atul Gawande - Medical practice
- Failure to cure disease a combination of ignorance (actual unknown cause of disease etc) and ineptitude (failure to properly apply knowledge we do have). Plus, necessary fallibility: cannot be perfect.
- Used to be dominated by ignorance, but perhaps now ineptitude. Personal example of his son - misdiagnosis due to oxygen monitor on wrong finger.
- Ineptitude related failures are embarrassing and so data can be suppressed: we don’t have the culture of airline black boxes, hospital complication rate transparency, etc.

## Reith Lecture - Kwame Anthony Appiah - Western culture and identity
_Country_
- Is the idea of “Western culture / civilisation” meaningful? Useful? If it originally distinguished between Europe and Asia, how to account for Americas and so on today?
- Classical Greek texts were actually saved by Islamic societies and reintroduced to Europe by occupation of Iberia, where Islamic rulers embraced advisors from multiple religions. So the idea of this defining Western culture doesn’t make sense given the overlap with the “East”.
- Creation of Western culture idea in Cold War as reaction to Soviets. Idea that it involves democracy, tolerance, etc extending back to ancient Greece: “Plato to NATO”. But actually democracy is recent and wasn’t dominant in most of Europe for most of history; we haven’t always been tolerant etc.
- “Western values” only mean something if they are actually understood and implement - they are not given factors of our society, nor are they unique to the West but can be readily absorbed elsewhere. You must study Plato not just inherit him.

_Creed_
- What we mean by “identity” has changed over time. Previously it was highly personal, more recently has become more defined in terms of broad social group.
- Religion consists of 3 things: practices, community and beliefs. In discussing religious identity we tend to overestimate the importance of beliefs and underestimate practice and community as means of social bonding.
- Items that might supposedly seem black and white may not be, e.g. Torah list of kosher foods doesn’t translate exactly to modern day; or rules may have been written in context of time and should be reinterpreted for present day.

## Reith Lecture - Vilanur Ramachandran - The brain
- Specific parts of brain associated with specific functions. When brain is damaged, interesting results can occur.
- Not recognising faces is quite well known as a disorder. But particular man  could recognise faces but thought they were imposters (eg mother) — basis was that the connection between face recognition area (fusiform gyrus) and emotional area (limbic system) — so he saw the face of his mother but didn’t emotionally connect and hence assumed imposter. Talking to her on phone, he was normal.
- Man with amputated arm had phantom limb, and sensation mapped to face — ie if you touched parts of his cheek, would feel sensation mapped in phantom thumb or index finger.

## ChinAI newsletter 
[Year 1 summary](https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-48-year-1-of-chinai)
- Language asymmetry -  most Chinese AI researchers are able to access English findings, but few western researchers access Chinese findings
- Chinese progress in AI is overestimated by most western analysts. Few firms are doing fundamental work and there is a lot of duplication and siloing even within firms.
- Chinese government sees AI as a key tool for social cohesion, and several Chinese firms are complicit in enabling this goal.

## Bob Iger - Masterclass
- High risk tolerance (_Aside: How many successful leaders are high risk tolerance + survivorship bias?_). Example of funding a police musical show which tanked, but same producer later brought him NYPD Blue, which succeeded. Example of pushing to make Black Panther and Captain Marvel with full budgets rather than treating them as side-projects.
- On-the-ground research about audience/consumers, rather than being beholden to aggregate data.
- Focused time for thinking each day. Cutting down strategy to just a few essentials, e.g. turning around Disney Animation because it was essential to the company. Committing to a course of action (e.g. not backing down from major acquisitions of Pixar or Fox despite potential difficulties).
- Reiterate basic values: make decisions quickly but do homework to prepare on them, act with integrity and honesty (including admitting and owning failure), be curious, project optimism to the team.

## Frank Gehry - Masterclass
- Maintaining your own voice - signature as example of unconsciously applying your own style.
- Sources of inspiration: carved marble folds in sculptures of Michelangelo (smooth, gradual) and Bernini (sharper) - cf to staggered bay windows on 8 Spruce Street skyscraper. Fish: giving a static sculpture or building a sense of movement.
- Building 1:10 scale models in order to test acoustics of concert hall. Doing the work to actually test something, rather than just speculate.
