# Brief book notes

## Cognitive Surplus, by Clay Shirky
Across developed economies, there is roughly a trillion hours of spare time per year. This is "cognitive surplus" available after working to meet everyday needs. Previously, this time has been spent on passive activities such as watching television. Increasingly, the internet is enabling it to be put to use in creative or community-driven activities.

Groups emerging in these ways can be equal or superior to traditionally organised groups. Examples include sites like Wikipedia, Ushahidi, and Josh Groban's charity-driven fanbase. Even meaningless creation, such as lolcats, is viewed by Shirky as better than non-creative activities, because it is still creation.

## The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki
The average estimate of a large number of people is often better than the estimate of a small number of experts. Two examples given are estimating (1) the weight of a cow at a country fair, and (2) the position of a sunken submarine.	

## The Unwinding, by George Packer
Covers the decline of the middle class and institutional framework of the United States over the last 40 years, by tracking five main stories: Tammy Thomas, a factory worker turned community organiser in the declining factory town Youngstown; Jeff Connaughton, a Washington insider witnessing the rise of lobbying; Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley; Dean Price, a struggling rural biofuel entrepreneur; and Tampa, a heartland of the subprime crisis.

A major theme is the detrimental impact of the financialisation of the US economy, in terms of hollowing out places like Youngstown via manufacturing closures; enabling the subprime crisis by repackaging debts in ways that shifted and concealed major risks; and having a corrupting influence on policymaking.

A memorable quote, from the profile of Raymond Carver: "He seemed to know, in the unintentional way of the fiction writer, that country's future would be most unnerving in its very ordinariness, in the late-night trip to the supermarket, the yard sale at the end of the line. He sensed that beneath the surface of life there was nothing to stand on."

## The New New Thing, by Michael Lewis
A biography of entrepreneur Jim Clark, supposedly the first person to found three separate billion-dollar companies: Silicon Graphics, Netscape, and Healthscape (later WebMD). He grew up poor but developed very ambitious visions of how to reshape significant parts of the economy, in an archetypal Silicon Valley way, and succeeded to some extent in realising them. He was also an early driver of the practice of rewarding engineers with substantial equity, instead of allowing financiers to take most of the profits.	

## The Innovator's Solution, by Clay Christensen
Following on from the Innovator's Dilemma, Christensen discusses how most businesses fail to achieve sustained growth, because they do not carefully plan how to build an engine for generating new disruptive businesses. These businesses should have independent resourcing, and be hungry for profit (so that they can stand alone and not have resources stripped by the rest of the organisation) but patient for growth (so that they can find the right product-market fit). Not clear how this applies to being a disruptive business yourself.	

## Boomerang, by Michael Lewis
Essays on the financial crisis, outside of Wall Street.
- Iceland, a sudden increase in investment banking, without any collective experience, driven to some extent by an aggressive culture.
- Greece, public servants overpaid for low performance, and tax fraud as a way of life.
- Ireland, reckless loans to property developers, at one point leading to as much housing being under construction in Ireland as the rest of the UK (which has 10x more people).
- Germany, which didn't have a bubble at home, but whose banks invested very badly overseas, buying up large amounts of the poor deals engineered (to fail) by sophisticated US banks.
- US states, especially California, whose enormous debts largely driven by public pensions are squeezing out other services.

## Beyond the Boom, by John Edwards
Australia's mining boom has not had as large an influence on Australia's economy as many claim. Growth on many measures was about the same in 1992-2002 as it was during the boom years (ie high export prices) of 2002-2012, even excluding the impact of the GFC. Apparent boom in Australia's GDP and wages was heavily due to changes in exchange rate against US dollar; measuring in PPP reduces the impact. Because Australia's mining industry is about 80% foreign owned, and mining is capital intensive (profit = 4x wages, vs profit = 2x wages in the wider economy), also reduced amount of economic impact here. For $100 mining value added after expenses, wages $20, state royalties $6, federal tax $14, foreign shareholders $48, Australian shareholders $12. Much of current federal deficit problems are due to cuts to personal income tax made when high company tax disguised the weakness of that revenue structure. During the boom, Australians also saved more, became more educated, and worked more than outside the boom, rather than wasting the inflow of income.	

## The Second Machine Age, by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee
- Inflection point in 1750 with steam engine. Almost no economic, social or population growth for previous 400 years.
- Exponential progress of Moore's Law not just in processing power but related areas like storage, chip energy efficiency, network speed
- Recent progress due to (1) Moore's Law, (2) Digitisation -> big data, (3) Recombinant innovation	

# The Name of God is Mercy, by Pope Francis
- "pardon is the instrument placed into our fragile hands to attain serenity of heart. To let go of anger, wrath, violence and revenge are necessary conditions to living joyfully."
- "whatever you did for these least brothers of mine, you did for me" Matthew 25:40
- "Corruption is not an act but a condition, a personal and social state in which we become accustomed to living. The corrupt man is so closed off and contented in the complacency of his self-sufficiency that be does not allow himself to be called into question by anything or anyone. The self-confidence he has built up is based on a fraudulent behaviour: he spends his life taking opportunistic shortcuts at the cost of his own and others' dignity."

# Wind Sand and Stars, by Antoine de Saint-Exupery
"The earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books in the world, because it is resistant to us. Self-discovery comes when man measures himself against an obstacle. To attain it, he needs an implement. He needs a carpenter's plane, or a plough. Little by little, as he walks behind the plough, the farmer forces out a few of nature's secrets, and the truth which he uncovers is universal. In the same way the aeroplane, the implement of the airline companies, brings man face to face with all the old problems."

Memorable scenes:
- Sitting on the pre-dawn airfield bus with bureaucrats.
- Comrade flying among Atlantic waterspouts like pillars of a temple.
- Comrade walking down from the Andes after crash-landing.
- Crash-landing on top of a Sahara mesa, previously untouched, and finding small meteorites across it.
- Being unable to distinguish between stars in the sky and lights on the ground, while flying in the pitch black desert at night.
- Providing an old servant/slave with freedom by buying him from owners.
- Crashing in Egypt and surviving for days with very little water: extreme hardship.

# On Tyranny, by Timothy Snyder
1. Do not obey in advance
2. Defend institutions: actively choose one to support
3. Beware the one-party state: support multi-party democracy, vote
4. Take responsibility for the face of the world: remove symbols of hate
5. Remember professional ethics
6. Be wary of paramilitaries, including violent rallies
7. Be reflective if you are armed (or part of the state apparatus); more Nazi killing was done by regular policemen than by the SS
8. Stand out; people must individually and uncomfortably resist for change to occur - e.g. Rosa Parks, people who assisted those in the ghettos
9. Be kind to language; do not repeat common phrases, but think about them yourself, and prefer books to the internet - cf. Orwell newspeak, Fahrenheit 451
10. Believe in truth, not a post-fact world - cf. Orwell doublethink
11. Investigate; spend more time on long-form, investigative reading
12. Make eye contact and small talk to support people who may feel excluded
13. Practise 'corporeal politics'; show up in the public square, don't just be online
14. Establish a private life; be careful of online presence
15. Contribute to good causes and participate in civil society, even non-political clubs that assist in establishing trust beyond immediate friends and family
16. Learn from peers in other countries; maintain international relationships
17. Listen for dangerous words: 'extremism', 'emergency', 'exceptional times'
18. Do not fall for unnecessary powers seized in the wake of attacks (Reichstag fire)
19. Be a patriot
20. Be courageous
"In politics, being deceived is no excuse" - Leszek Kolakowski

# City of Fortune, by Roger Crowley
(A history of Venice focused on the Fourth Crusade.)
* Lack of arable land meant no feudal class based on extracting labour from peasants; instead noble influence grew from entrepreneurial merchant ventures.
* Strong central/communal control unlike libertarian Genoa. Heavy coordination and regulations on trade routes (prices and timing), ambassadors, etc. Large ships owned by state but leased to merchants. Annual routes to Egypt etc enabled reliability of supply which encouraged other merchants to buy in Venice.
* Fourth Crusade destined for Jerusalem but diverted into sacking Constantinople as part of internal Byzantine struggle. Chaotic siege with towers built on ships assaulting the sea wall; charge led by 90 year old blind doge Dandolo. Pope had excommunicated the crusaders but leaders didn't tell the troops.
* Venetian colonial empire on Crete, Cyprus, far edge of Black Sea with Mongols, etc. Stuck to ports rather than pushing inland in say Greece. In Mamluk Egypt, practiced consistent diplomacy.
* Wars with Genoa almost led to downfall including one that came right to the lagoon. European and Byzantine infighting allowed gradual rise of Ottomans who, by conducting combined land-sea operations against ports, were able to take over territory and squeeze out Venice's stronger navy.
