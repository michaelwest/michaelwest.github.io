Probably a naive non-artist's viewpoint...

- Religion for Atheists: museum organised by emotional theme, not historical period
- Same should go for school curricula? How can history class explicitly focus on teaching how to detect fake news and unreliable sources in the modern day, rather than just having these as implicit side skills from studying a past war?

- Deliberately accessible art - not a novel idea, but still probably the minority

- Explicitly moralising public art

- Architecture as accessible art - most modern buildings don't have the same emotional resonance, or aspiration to impact the life of an ordinary citizen, as an old cathedral
- Hegel: Art should focus on the sensuous presentation of important ideas
