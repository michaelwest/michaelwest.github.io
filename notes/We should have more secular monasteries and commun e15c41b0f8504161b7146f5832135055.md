# We should have more secular monasteries and communes

### Motivation

Anglophone Western society is dominated by:

- Attention-grabbing technology and interruption-tolerant work practices that makes concentration on long-term projects difficult.

    [Deep Work](../References%2044e0a6dd2a7a456b83710224626907e7/Deep%20Work%2054f8187f77504c81a3c63f9fc726edc5.md)

- Separated living arrangements focused on a single nuclear family or individual, and declining participation in community groups, which can lead to weakening of social bonds.

One way to tackle these might be for more people to live (even temporarily) in monastery or commune-like environments. The idea is to enforce disconnection from typical day-to-day routines in order to create space for deeper project or reflection work, or deeper social bonds.

### Modern monasteries fall short

Some quasi-monastic retreats exist already. They are typically focused on practices such as meditation, mindfulness, and spirituality — rather than also providing space for secular intellectual deep work. Considering medieval monasteries, that mixed religious observance with secular work (e.g. manuscript illumination, Mendel's pea experiments), this seems like a gap. Examples of these incomplete modern monasteries include:

Within organisations, there is limited support for short-duration activities like offsite retreats, hackathons, or Bill Gates’ “reading weeks”. But these are often not really very deep or disconnected, and thus not very different to the existing norm.

### Universities as monasteries?

You might argue that some secular research function of the medieval monastery is fulfilled by universities and other research institutions. But the business of research is apparently now so bureaucratised and metrics-driven that it does not really seem to provide for the free, unhurried, disconnected enquiry that is the goal here.

### What would a modern monastery do?

The key aspect is a living arrangement and set of work practices that emphasises deep, craftsman-style work on a narrowly focused mission, rather than an expansive enterprise.

David Dewane’s “Eudaimonia Machine” might be one example of how to architect the monastery’s space to span the gamut of team interaction through to intense individual work. This  would be combined with an appropriate daily schedule and rituals.

Samo Burja suggests the example of a monastery devoted to perfecting software. You could imagine a support model similar to GitHub Sponsors, or even just commercial sales of a tightly-scoped product. This does not seem like it would work at the scale of a product like Microsoft Office.

### Communes

Separately, there might also be a role for non-monastic communes, that emphasise the idea of multiple friends or families living in a shared environment for mutual support, but not necessarily disconnecting from the rest of the world. This is reminiscent of Epicurus's commune.

This idea has gained some currency as an extension of:

- 'squads' and the 'cozy web' — private spaces, protected from the dominant social media flows that can provide permanent and harsh judgement to activities recorded on social media
- the trend to move out of high-cost-of-living cities such as SF Bay Area, which don't necessarily have correspondingly high quality of life: for the cost of a small city apartment, might be able to buy a large block of rural land and establish a commune with friends
- 'co-living spaces' that mix small private bedrooms with larger shared facilities ([ref](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/03/co-living-the-end-of-urban-loneliness-or-cynical-corporate-dormitories))
