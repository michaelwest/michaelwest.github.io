Should we devote more to "critical innovation"?

- What is critical?
    - Atoms rather than bits?

    - But DTC (e.g. Casper, Haus) not critical
    - And some services critical: healthcare etc
    - Sectors? Time to Build, Founders Fund manifesto
- Confounding
    - Border cases: Google (framing as ad server vs framing as critical infra for knowledge workers)
    - Transition cases: games > GPUs > ML; Unity to speed up construction; WebGL used by SpaceX

- Why do people care about the idea of frivolity?
    - Industrial sovereignty
    - Things that actually arenâ€™t about innovation, just basic society functioning eg NIMBY/red tape on housing
    - Sense of justice around investment outcomes: Snap, HN "I could build that"
    - Sense of being lectured at: Clubhouse vs Time to Build
- What does it mean "we devote more"? Who is "we" and should they do?
    - A16Z advocacy vs actually investing themselves
        - VC is tiny; VC should pursue many fields
    - Is there evidence of fall-off in input investment in unarguably critical sectors? especially by government?
