Some non-industrial aspects of American life assume an industrial quality relative to other nations:

- American football in comparison to rugby
- US debate in comparison to UK/AU debate
- Hollywood writers' rooms compared to UK (Stephen Merchant)

Does this say anything interesting about the American character?

Are there just as many counterexamples? (Basketball? Jazz vs classical music?)
