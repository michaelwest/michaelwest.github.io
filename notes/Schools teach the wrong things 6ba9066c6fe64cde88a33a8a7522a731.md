**Dilettante Alert**: I have no actual expertise in this area and others have probably thought about it a lot more than me; there may be good reasons why the below has not happened.

- Too specific with irrelevant focus: calculus, geometry not important to most people
- Simultaneously not teaching general life skills: teamwork
    - See Plato section

- School of Life concept that humanities institutions (museums, universities) should be structured thematically rather than say by nationality or chronology of artists
- Or preparation for particular facets of life, personal finance, media bias, etc - more stats less calculus
- Preparation for working with machines; “computational thinking”, creative project-based learning

- Thematic social history, how society works, rather than names-and-dates (some of this has already happened but still tend to zoom in on particular eras too much rather than broad sweeps)
