Examples of institutions (real or fictional) that blur or cross categories in unexpected ways. 

- **Typically public/state functions being performed by a non-state actor**
    - *Snow Crash* has **multiple examples of blurring between state, private and underworld functions: Mafia as quasi-state with openly functioning FBI-style law enforcement apparatus; franchised embassies; privatised national defence groups
    - Hezbollah's extensive work in delivering social services (hospitals, schools, news, etc) to the Lebanese Shia population, building political support and helping to legitimise its paramilitary activities ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah_social_services))
    - Private military contractors - perhaps more blurred today than in the past, since there is a stronger monopoly on state use of violence now; mercenaries were normal in pre-Westphalian times

    - Company-states like the British and Dutch East India Companies

        [Outsourcing Empire](../References%2044e0a6dd2a7a456b83710224626907e7/Outsourcing%20Empire%206723dc8e9f584d02936d8873d1f96182.md)

        - Fictional company-states such as Weyland-Yutani and the metanationals in *Red Mars*
    - Shift of crewed spaceflight from publicly-operated to commercial via e.g. SpaceX
- **A stereotypically one-dimensional organisation visibly taking on aspects of other organisations that seem incongruous with its core purpose**
    - Al Qaeda's bureaucracy of expense reports and performance reviews ([ref](https://www.npr.org/2013/05/29/187147334/even-terrorists-have-to-fill-out-expense-reports))
    - Similar corporate practices for major drug cartels

    - Any time a movie shows corporate or industrial detail for a fairytale (e.g. Pixar short *Prep & Landing*: flight control at Santa's Workshop - [ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT1cazuTWCw))
- **Anachronistic sub-units of an institution that has a historically fixed stereotype**
    - Ensign Peak - the Mormon Church's $100B investment fund ([ref](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mormon-church-amassed-100-billion-it-was-the-best-kept-secret-in-the-investment-world-11581138011))
    - In-Q-Tel - the CIA's venture capital arm
    - Potentially others as per:

    - The Twitter bot [Concept Collider](https://twitter.com/ColliderConcept) generates random combinations of concepts that might provide ideas for blurred institutions.

**Operationalise**
Ask whether an existing institution's purpose could function with a different mode of operation. Could a charity's work be more effectively served if it functioned more like an investment bank or a venture capital firm? Or vice versa: would a service culture rather than a transactional culture help a deal-making firm to drive better results? 

Is there space for a new organisation, set up in a novel way, to tackle a problem set? What organisational forms existed in the past but don't exist now â€” perhaps without any good reason?

Is a competing organisation vulnerable because it has to endure more bureaucracy or other processes than you'd immediately expect from thinking about it stereotypically?
