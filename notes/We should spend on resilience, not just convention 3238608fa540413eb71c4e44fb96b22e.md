I am interested in whether our current model of defence procurement is best equipping us to defend against the threats we face in a risk-weighted way. I think that in an era when our adversaries are aggressively pursuing sub-conflict hybrid warfare, and when the impacts of 'natural' threats such as pandemic and disasters are being are clearly felt, that we should devote relatively more of our focus to assets that will be useful in combatting those, and less to fighting a peer-style conventional conflict.
