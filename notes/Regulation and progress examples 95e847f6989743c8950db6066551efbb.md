Collecting examples of where government regulation either stifles, or enables in a new way, some form of progress (R&D, deployment, infrastructure build, etc)

### Stifling

- Enforced monopoly - Yucca Mountain - impact on developing new nuclear waste options

    [Deep Isolation](../Companies%201c07a9688a58400e9370fe0a619923c1/Deep%20Isolation%2018e39ddabf53437faf1ce2987be624de.md)

- Red tape
    - SF permitting process - ice cream store example: [https://twitter.com/_fruchtose/status/1271280300228632576?s=20](https://twitter.com/_fruchtose/status/1271280300228632576?s=20)
    - CDC slowing COVID test development

        [Why America’s Institutions Are Failing - The Atlantic](../References%2044e0a6dd2a7a456b83710224626907e7/Why%20America%E2%80%99s%20Institutions%20Are%20Failing%20-%20The%20Atlan%20cbc8446f74bf42a59765539e90450341.md)

- Eli Dourado
    - Cargo drones stifled by FAA requiring 1:1 ratio of drone:pilot
    - EU stifling supersonic to protect Airbus
    - Environmental impact statements slow projects without substantively protecting the environment; lengths of EIS have ballooned 10-100X since they were originally introduced (→ slowness is both new regulation we didn't use to have, and worse enforcement of that regulation)

        [Environmental review paperwork - NEPA](../References%2044e0a6dd2a7a456b83710224626907e7/Environmental%20review%20paperwork%20-%20NEPA%205b01b79c826f4d6b8561062466a61260.md)

### Enabling

- US NRC Oklo modified licence approach

    [Oklo - first advanced fission licence granted](../References%2044e0a6dd2a7a456b83710224626907e7/Oklo%20-%20first%20advanced%20fission%20licence%20granted%205f8c6c34679548c1b6333883e41af495.md)

- FAA granting waiver to let Skydio drones fly beyond line of sight when inspecting infrastructure like bridges

    [Skydio gains FAA approval to conduct bridge inspections with drones in North Carolina](https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/05/skydio-gains-faa-approval-to-conduct-bridge-inspections-with-drones-in-north-carolina/)
