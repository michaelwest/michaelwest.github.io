People more important than ideas - mediocre team will kill a good idea, a great team will fix or circumvent a mediocre idea
Hire for potential, not for current skill level
People must always feel free to suggest ideas; if there is more truth in hallways than meetings, there is a problem.
Finding and fixing problems is everybody's job. Anybody should be able to stop the production line.
Candor is necessary in addressing why things are not the best they could be.
Efforts like braintrust meetings, daily feedback, postmortems, and company-wide Notes Day provide structured encouragement to promote ideas.
Notes Day
Braintrust meetings focus on giving advice from experienced people to newer directors
Focus on the problem rather than the person; the director ultimately chooses what advice to accept.
The first conclusions we draw from success and failure are typically wrong (eg fundamental attribution bias).
Important to critically evaluate the process, not just celebrate/commiserate the outcome.
The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them, and no prevention program is perfect.
Failure is a necessary consequence of trying new things.
The desire for everything to run smoothly is a false goal which leads to measuring people by the mistakes they make, rather than by their ability to solve problems. Do not accidentally make stability a goal.
Don't confuse the process with the goal. Working on our processes to make them better, easier and more efficient is vital but not the goal. Making a great product is the goal.
It is important to build capability to recover from unexpected events, while also trying to uncover unseen factors.
Crises are not always bad - the process of responding to crisis often brings people together.
Show early and show often, instead of waiting for perfection.
Protect new ideas that represent the future, rather than protecting the past.
A company's communication structure should not mirror its organisational structure.
Everybody should be able to talk to everybody.
Don't create too many rules, which are demeaning to 95% of people - just use common sense in disciplining the other 5%.
Imposing limits can encourage a creative response.
Excellent work can emerge from uncomfortable or seemingly untenable circumstances.
An organisation as a whole is more resistant to change than the individuals within it.
Do not assume that general agreement will lead to change.
The healthiest organisations are made up of departments whose agendas differ but whose goals are interdependent.
