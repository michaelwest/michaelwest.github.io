I'm interested in how societies continue to develop and apply new technology to raise living standards for their citizens. Some people believe that the rate of such progress in advanced Western economies has slowed in comparison to the mid-20th century. Understanding if this is true, and how to fix it if so, spans topics like innovation, history, education, regulation, culture, and organisational effectiveness. Patrick Collison and Tyler Cowen have branded this grouping 'progress studies'.
