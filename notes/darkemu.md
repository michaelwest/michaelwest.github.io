- **Basic premise**: Aboriginal people were not all nomadic hunter-gatherers, but actually engaged in agriculture and permanent settlements. These are evidenced in archaeology (which has had limited attention) and early European colonial reports, but underemphasised because of the basic belief in nomadism and  colonial self-interest in maintaining the *terra nullius* idea.
- 🌾🍠 **Agriculture**: furrowed planting, use of native grass seed crops, grindstones for milling, fields of yams and tubers. Evidence that crops were domesticated, relying on human intervention to spread. Fire based management. Some of these now being tested for modern use, eg myrnong (daisy yam tuber) or native millet.
- 🐟 **Aquaculture**: large scale fish traps (rock dams and pools, “races” with cane/reed directing fish into catch areas, sluices). Many since damaged due to colonial rock scavenging. Fishing and whaling made use of other species, eg hunting whales injured by orcas. Brewarrina fish trap has (uncertain) claim to being oldest construction in the world:

- 🏡 **Housing**: hut buildings were often permanent, mud covered, and fairly comfortable; largest could hold 40 people. Many colonial reports of settlements with hundreds or thousands of people.
- ⚱️**Preservation** of large harvests supporting gatherings: bunya bunya nuts, or bogong moths! Moths singed in hot ashes to remove wings and legs, then roasted - high fat content. Pottery was quite simple. Smoking fish/eels.
- 🔥 **Fire**: regular burning in mosaic pattern to prevent buildup of undergrowth. Early colonists reported landscape like English parks; easy to ride through forests. Aborigines reserved better soils for crops with worse left for forest. Europeans subsequently underused fire.
- ⚖️ **Governance**: Aborigines communally and sustainably managed resources, across social group boundaries, for thousands of years. No major wars of conquest. What can we learn from that? Shouldn’t necessarily judge “level of development” purely by European standards.
