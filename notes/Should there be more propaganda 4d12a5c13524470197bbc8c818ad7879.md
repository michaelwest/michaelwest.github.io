Defining propaganda: art commissioned to promote a particular ideological viewpoint.

- Art - visual, performance, TV, etc, not just awareness ad campaigns
- Commissioned - by an individual, organisation or government, not just the artist's preference
- Promoting a viewpoint - deliberate desire to influence, not just provoke conversation

In the past Disney created films either directly for government or at own cost with a specific futurist vision.

*The UFWD commands substantial resources for propaganda efforts targeting the Chinese diaspora. It runs China News Service (中国新闻社), one of the CCP’s largest media networks, which has dozens of overseas bureaus... At least 26 WeChat accounts run by nine Chinese media outlets are in fact registered to a subsidiary of China News Service. The accounts operate in all Five Eyes countries, the European Union, Russia, Japan and Brazil... China News Service engages with foreign media through its biennial Forum on the Global Chinese Language Media (世界华文媒体论坛). The event has drawn hundreds of overseas media representatives, including some from Australia’s national broadcaster. Training classes on topics such as ‘How to tell the Belt and Road Initiative’s story well’ are held on the sidelines of the forum.*
