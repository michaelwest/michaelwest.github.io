This formulation is from Samo Burja as part of his Great Founder Theory:

[Great Founder Theory - Samo Burja](../References%2044e0a6dd2a7a456b83710224626907e7/Great%20Founder%20Theory%20-%20Samo%20Burja%20ed317d26d1e1498b97b0381dc129421f.md)

> *A live player is a person or a tightly coordinated group of people that is able to do things they have not done before. A dead player is a person or a group of people that is working off a script, incapable of doing new things.*

Important aspects are:

- Ability to identify changing circumstances
    - As opposed to being stuck in a conventional narrative
- Ability to take meaningful action in response to the circumstances
    - As opposed to workshopping, reassuring satisfaction with status quo, deflecting blame
    - Burja talks about difference between tight coordination between exceptional individuals (live players) and ossified formal structures (dead players)

### Examples of live players

- Silicon Valley VCs + companies embracing early action on coronavirus
    - Contrast: tech media mocking companies for taking this early action
- Burja: Russian state under Putin — annexation of Crimea
    - Note however that the Russian economy may be dead, running on Soviet-era fumes
- Australian Governments undertaking reform
    - Hawke + Keating economic reform
    - Howard guns ban
    - Snowy Hydro scheme
- Elon Musk — SpaceX, Tesla
- Historic examples of economic development like Singapore, Dubai
    - Contrast Dubai opportunism around creating tourism and freight hub to Abu Dhabi which remains heavily reliant on oil

### Examples of dead players

- Recent Australian governments + political parties? Minimal major reform
- Beltway-bandit contractors
- Burja argues that Apple has been a dead player since Steve Jobs passed away — "a bureaucracy imitating his taste".
- NIMBY governance in places like California
    - General zero-sum / entrenched-paradigm governance, eg binary regulation of Uber/Lyft: why hasn’t it been possible to create a new construct that combines driver flexibility with some benefits?
