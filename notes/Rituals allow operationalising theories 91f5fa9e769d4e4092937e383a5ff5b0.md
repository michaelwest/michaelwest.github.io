# Rituals allow operationalising theories

I’m interested in how people and organisations can make use of rituals to operationalise their knowledge.

We theoretically know a lot about how to do things. There is plenty of high-quality writing (and even more low-quality…) about every field, and about organisations and management in general. Plus, we all have lived experience. But I feel that there are large differences between people and organisations in (1) capturing and (2) operationally applying this knowledge. Apparently only a [single-digit percentage](https://hbr.org/podcast/2017/08/basic-competence-can-be-a-strategy) of firms consistently apply basic management practices like meetings having an agenda and follow-ups.

Ritual practices seem to have the potential to make this capture and application more automatic. By ritual, I mean a practice that has a specific and non-obvious form, not just something like a daily team meeting or a monthly team social.

Some examples of rituals: 

- **Five Whys**. A meeting technique for interrogating a problem to discover root causes, without personally victimising participants, and developing follow-up preventative actions. Originally developed as part of the Toyota Production System; now used in many organisations.
- **Safety shares**. Some companies, especially in mining and construction, start every meeting with a “safety share” - somebody present describing a personal experience of a health and safety incident. This applies even to white-collar meetings, where the participants might share something from their home lives (e.g. an incident with a repair contractor), the idea being to instil a culture of safety across the whole organisation.
- **Bed making in the military**. The US military expends effort on inspecting junior soldiers’ beds to ensure they are properly made, as a ritual means of instilling discipline and attention to detail. (This also applies to similar practices like rifle cleaning, although some also have clear practical purposes.)
- **After-action reviews**. Originally a US military practice, and now conducted by many organisations, but [usually poorly](https://hbr.org/2005/07/learning-in-the-thick-of-it). Figuring out how to actually apply the lessons obtained from an AAR - e.g. via another ritual - can be a challenge.
- **Brains-trust meetings**. At Pixar, an experienced group of directors give candid feedback on other works in progress. You can generalise this to “there should be a formal, regular process for people to receive expert feedback on the direction of creative work.” Mandatory murder-boards for things like external pitches and presentations are in a similar vein.

- **No-meeting days**. Some companies, including Basecamp, have learnt that meetings impact productivity and have actually taken action by instituting particular days as designated no-meeting times.
- The [Ritual Design Lab](https://www.ritualdesignlab.org/ritual-design-projects/) designs secular rituals for corporate clients. But many seem pretty trivial: there is one that involves eating a parking ticket, and others that are basically office graduation ceremonies or office parties. The “**meeting escape hatch**” - where anyone can leave a meeting after 1 minute with no judgement, if it’s not relevant - is potentially useful.
- Benjamin Franklin’s Junto Club had a **regular set of questions to prompt discussion** at their weekly meeting.

- The Roman slave continually whispering ***memento mori***, "remember that you will die", in the ear of a commander celebrating a Triumph. *Remember that you have a finite amount of resources and time* is probably something that should be continually whispered within many organisations and maybe implemented via tools. For example, there could be an Outlook plugin where you can specify a time budget for a thread, forcing you to finalise things that aren't important quickly.
- [Beating the bounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beating_the_bounds), a physical ritual to pass on knowledge from one generation to the next
- YouTube rituals, especially around setting the right metrics targets and conducting planning activities towards them (eg getting OKRs on the right cadence)

Some questions to consider about rituals:

- How might you design rituals to counter common thinking fallacies, such as bikeshedding or availability bias? These would probably be in-meeting practices designed to act as circuit breakers for fuzzy thinking.

- If you adopt a ritual, how do you monitor performance and ensure true gains, not just a cargo-cult simulation of whoever originally designed it? (Is there a cultural context that makes these rituals successful, rather than the rituals themselves?)
