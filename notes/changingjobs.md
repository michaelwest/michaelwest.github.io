# Changing Jobs: The fair go in the new machine age
## Jim Chalmers & Mike Quigley

A useful (if not super novel) Australian summary of potential impacts of automation, and potential policy responses. 2017.

### Impacts of automation
- Jobs most vulnerable are **routine**. Most physical jobs actually aren't routine. Moravec's paradox: high-level reasoning is easier than physical movement and sensing, so it is easier to replace some 'high-skilled' jobs such as translating or accounting than many 'low-skilled' jobs such as gardening or cooking. "Musical showdown" example: Bach vs academic vs computer; audience picked computer's piece as the Bach.
- New technology companies create **fewer jobs**. Examples of WhatsApp ($19B, 55 staff) and Instagram ($1B, 13 staff). _Note some counter-examples like Amazon, ~600K staff, but probably generally true._
- Reference to Sapiens discussing the **Agricultural Revolution**, in context of technology might advance even though most people are worse off.
- **Hollowing-out** of mid-skill jobs. For Aus 1991-2011, middle-pay occupations -8.5%, split among high-pay and low-pay. Similar in most OECD countries.
- Estimates vary on how many jobs are **susceptible to automation**. Analysis either at job level or task level. 
  - Frey and Osborne: ~ half of US jobs in high risk category, >70% chance of atuomation in next two decades. Low-wage jobs most likely to disappear.
  - Durrant-Whyte: 40% of Aus jobs at high risk, using same method as Frey and Osborne.
  - OECD: task-level analysis, only 9% of jobs at high risk since even if some tasks are automatable, many aren't.
  - McKinsey: at least one-third of tasks are automatable in ~60% of jobs.
  - _Interesting to think here about whether 'automatable tasks' actually implies job loss, or just higher productivity. Salesperson data entry vs making more sales calls._
- Potential that AI shakes up **underperforming industries**, for the better. Richard Susskind on the professions: "By and large, our professions are unaffordable, under-exploiting technology, disempowering, ethically challengeable, underperforming, and inscrutable."
- Mention of Tyler Cowen's workers in two camps: "one capable of working with machines, the other replaced by them". _Above and below the API, Venkatesh Rao._

### Inequality & current economy
- Stats on inequality:
  - US: Median real household income fell 10% from 1999 to 2011.
  - US: Real wealth of bottom 80% in US decreased from 1983 to 2009.
  - Aus: In decade to 2017, bottom 20% had +25% income and +4% wealth, but top 20% had +42% income and +38% wealth.
  - Aus: Top 1% wealthier than bottom 70%; wealth share of top 1% has doubled since 1970s.
- Reasons for inequality include globalisation, technology job displacement, cuts to top tax rates, more tax exemptions. _And real estate?_
- **Intergenerational mobility** is very low in the US: likelihood that earnings are predicted by parents' earnings is almost as high as aristocratic UK. Australia middle of the pack; Scandinavia has highest mobility. Mobility correlated with income equality.
- Lack of wage growth as wages have **decoupled** from productivity and profits. In Aus, labour compensation as % of GDP hit lowest ever level in 2017.
- Migrants hold almost all of the full-time jobs created in Australia since 2007! "being hired for work that the locals are not qualified for" - George Megalogenis.
- Miles Corak: Investment in education decreases inequality only if spent on early education; if spent on university, it may actually increase inequality.

### Education
- Aus: Less students are taking **maths** in high school. In 2001, ~10% took no maths; in 2014, 23% took no maths. And basic maths now a larger fraction of those who do take maths. Cultural aspects: it is fine to say "I'm hopeless at maths" in Australia.
- Maths/Science education must evolve to include more **"computational thinking"** Computational thinking around formulating a problem systematically so that a computer can perform calculations. Implication that you must write a program as an output. _Seems slightly narrow - broader issues around understanding what's possible with data/logic; expressing the flow without writing code would be sufficient._ 
- Have short **specialised courses** for adults, e.g. 'computational thinking for accountants', 'data analysis for logistics'. In a retraining context for displaced workers, needs to look more like an apprenticeship than a degree, to avoid demotivation at having to fully start over. Singapore SkillsFuture model where people do ongoing training as a regular part of their jobs. How do you make MOOC-like options routine for people who aren't already highly educated?
- Improving **teacher quality**, e.g. via embedding university-student mentors into classrooms - Victoria In2Science program with 2K mentors reaching 50K students. _Right scale!_
- Queensland is making coding and robotics compulsory, and has a Digital Solutions syllabus for problem-based learning of code and UI. Separately, potential to add more probability and statistics, rather than calculus and geometry. 
  - Suggestions to add more computing to other subjects, e.g. social network graph of book characters, colour distribution analysis of paintings.
- Historical example of UK where upper class received classical education that wasn't actually suited for business, and didn't compete well with US and Germany.
- Categorisation of digital competence (UK): Muggle (tech may as well be magic); Citizen (communicate, find info, purchase); Worker (evaluate, configure and use complex systems; maybe elementary programming); Maker (can build software).
- More researchers in industry: one-third of PhDs in industry in Aus, compared to two-thirds in US.


### Government responses to automation
- **Universal basic income** a bad idea in authors' view. Dignity of work. Backwards step for equality if it's universal, given Australia's existing progressive welfare system. Huge cost: $360 billion for Aus if at level of age pension, vs current welfare and social services budget of ~$160 billion (17-18). Top tax rate would be 75% if funded by income tax.
- If welfare is based on a 'reciprocal obligation' component (cf. work for the dole), then it should have an "emphasis on volunteering, caring and mentoring" to ensure that participants maintain sense of social worth.
- Options for **income smoothing** - some essentially just "pay a lot of tax while employed, access a lot of govt help while unemployed"; others maybe incentives for private wage insurance or contributing to unemployment savings accounts.
- Govt must become better at **skills matching** at granular level within jobs, to help people transition to other jobs that might use their skills.
- Govt support for **retraining**, e.g. income-contingent loans, tax-advantaged learning accounts that workers pay into and can then access later.
- **Portability of entitlements** and protections as more workers begin to change jobs frequently or work multiple jobs at once.
- Workers should have larger equity stakes in their companies so that profits don't entirely accrue to owners.
- Consider shifting emphasis away from GDP as a primary measure, since it's less suited for digital services; maybe  to real disposable income per capita.
