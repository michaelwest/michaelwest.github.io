Collecting some examples of less obvious, more niche mental models:

[Live players and dead players (Burja)](Live%20players%20and%20dead%20players%20(Burja)%20db1c2c4d66d0435c93dc2c1fa97477cc.md)

Pace layers:

These are in addition to well-known generic mental models (e.g. Pareto principle) as described here:
