### Confluence

- Immediacy, staleness: type to edit, not edit mode

- How do you get info to the person who needs it, when they need it? Rather than having simultaneus large mass of hard-to-explore info, while people are reinventing the wheel?

### Jira

- Usability vs configurability (there are always way too many fields)
    - why is it a tradeoff instead of config improving usability?
    - Are many instances misconfigured - and if so why
    - maybe poor defaults, limited setup support -- cf "concierge onboardings"
- Heavyweight vs lightweight competitors - should there be a simple checkbox mode? What's the right balance vs apps like Linear? What has changed in new Jira?

[Linear](../Companies%201c07a9688a58400e9370fe0a619923c1/Linear%2041ed43e5bce4460f8a60c2d34a07b65c.md)

- Absorption of add-on plugins
- How do people actually use Jira? Backwards? Plan separately, then enter tasks and updates later? Is it the real source of truth?
- How can you use it under pressure? Why do people revert to very simple methods like whiteboards? Related to simplicity.
