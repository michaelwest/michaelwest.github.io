# Quarterly Essay: Red Flag

### CCP ideology and organs
- China Dream: "rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation"; middle-income by 2021 and high-income by 2049; recovered Taiwan and Hong Kong by 2049.
- Xi's "seven taboos" to resist, from (secret) _Communique on the Current State of the Ideological Sphere_: Western constitutional democracy (including independent judiciaries and armed forces), universal values, civil society organisations, neoliberal market forces, journalism and free press, "historical nihilism", and questioning of CCP's current approaches to economic reform.
- Xi: "the eventual demise of capitalism and the ultimate victory of socialism must be a long historical process"; "conscientiously prepare for all aspects of long-term cooperation and struggle between the two social systems".
- United Front stems from Mao's time (one of "three magic weapons" along with party-building and armed struggle); priority focus on overseas Chinese students, individuals in new media, and young entrepreneurs/businesspeople.

### CCP pressure on other governments

| Country | Year | Trigger | Pressure | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| France | 2008 | President met with Dalai Lama | Suspended Airbus order, cancelled tradee delegations | None immediately, but no further meetings |
| Japan | 2010 | Fishing captain arrested near Senkakus | Cut exports of rare earth metals | Japan invested in other mines; no further arrests |
| Norway | 2010 | Nobel Peace Prize awarded to dissident Liu Xiaobo | Froze diplomatic contacts and trade negotiations, cut salmon imports | PM and FM made pro-China statements |
| Philippines | 2012 | South China Sea territorial dispute | Cut imports of bananas | President backed away from US alliance and visited Beijing |
| UK | 2012 | PM met with Dalai Lama | High-level contact frozen | PM declared opposition to Tibetan independence and welcomed Chinese investment |
| Taiwan | 2016 | Elected pro-democracy president | Tourism cuts, political freeze, military exercises | None |
| Mongolia | 2016 | Dalai Lama visited | Tariffs on mining exports, loan negotiation freeze | Govt apologised and committed not to repeat |
| Australia | 2016 | Labor (opposition) support for freedom-of-navigation in South China Sea | Offered large political donation to reverse position | None |
| South Korea | 2017 | Planned for US-made missile defence system | Tourism cut by 60%, sanctions on Korean business | Pro-China opposition candidate elected |
| Palau | 2017 | Continued to recognise Taiwan | Tourism cut by 30% | None |
| Australia | 2017 | Labor (opposition) against extradition treaty | Threat to create political opposition to Labor among ethnic Chinese | None | 
| Canada | 2018 | Arrested Huawei CFO on US fraud charge | Arrested two Canadians, agricultural import cuts | None |
| Australia | 2019 | Unclear, possibly Huawei/ZTE ban | Restrictions on thermal coal imports | None  |

Often the trigger is implicit rather than explicit. "Beijing uses uncertainty over the reason for punishment to train countries into anticipating its wishes and fearing its wrath."

### Belt and Road
- "Community of common destiny" connected to the idea of _tianxia_, "all under heaven"
- $440 billion spent by mid-2019, 3x cost of Marshall Plan
- Not just infrastructure: also policy coordination, unimpeded trade, financial integration, people-to-people communication
- "String of pearls" ports for Indian Ocean connectivity to oil supply; Indian "chain of flowers" in response
- Pakistan is China's only "all-weather strategic cooperative partner"

### Hybrid war
- "We believe that some morning people will awake to discover with surprise that quite a few gentle and kind things have begun to have offensive and lethal characteristics." - from _Unrestricted Warfare_, a 1999 book by two PLA colonels. (Also, "the first rule of unrestricted warfare is that there are no rules, with nothing forbidden".)
- Asymmetric weapons - hypersonic anti-ship missiles to prevent carrier operations, rather than seeking carrier parity.
- Metaphor from NSA cyber advisor: Russia is the hurricane, "comes in fast and hard"; China is climate change, "long, slow, pervasive".

### Political interference in Australia
- FITS Act requires foreign lobbying organisations and individuals to register, but not enforced well - many obvious organisations have not registered.
- Politicisation - PM called investigation of Liberal MP Gladys Liu "racist", but was fine with investigation of Labor MP Ernest Wong.
- Popular opinion (Lowy polls 2019 vs 2018): trust in China down to 32% from 52%, foreign interference rated as critical threat up to 49% from 41%.
- At least 300 United Front associations in Sydney; hundreds across Australia. Examples: Australian Council for Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China; Chinese Students and Scholars Associations; China-Australia Entrepreneurs Association; Australian Guangdong Chamber of Commerce. 

### Potential responses
- Broader citizenship education to educate citizens on democratic responsibilities.
- Political party donations to be tightened: ban cash donations, more disclosure and policing (Austrac), impose caps, create federal ICAC.
- Require MPs to have a security clearance.
- Bipartisan approach to minimise wedging; potential coordinated bipartisan position / body.
- Diversify economic engagement - cf. thermal coal (well diversified, not impacted much) vs potential harm to universities (over-exposed).
- Relief/resilience fund to reduce vulnerability to CCP-created freezes.
- Stronger immigration screening to reduce immigration of, e.g., United Front organisers, and potentially boost Taiwan/HK vs mainland China intake.
- Improve cyber defensive capability.
